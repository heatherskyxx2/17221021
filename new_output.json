    "content": "The United Kingdom on Wednesday reported 1,564 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test from Covid-19, a record daily toll, with the number of cases also rising slightly on the day before.\n\nThe reported number of deaths far exceeds the 1,325 recorded on January 8 and comes as Britain battles a new more highly transmissible variant of the virus.\n\nThere were another 47,525 cases, up from 45,533 on Tuesday.\n\nThere have now been almost 85,000 deaths in Britain - the fifth highest figure globally - and 3.2 million have tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nAlthough the death figure continues to rise, the number of reported cases over the last week has been falling from a record high of 68,053, also recorded on January 8, suggesting lockdown measures were beginning to take effect.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there are about 32,000 Covid patients in hospitals, about 70 percent more than during the peak of the first outbreak last April, and he said the risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed was substantial.\n\n\"(Health workers) now really are fighting very, very hard to contain this pandemic after months and months in which they've really been working flat out and I think the strain is colossal,\" he told lawmakers.

    "content": "Phil Foden fired Manchester City into third place in the Premier League on Wednesday as Pep Guardiola's men saw off a feisty challenge from Brighton to win 1-0. Tottenham could have gone above City had they won their late kick-off but Spurs were denied by visiting Fulham in a 1-1 draw.\n\nMuch of the recent talk has been about a potential duel between leaders Manchester United and champions Liverpool but Pep Guardiola's men are now right in the mix.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 champions started the season sluggishly but have hit the accelerator in recent weeks and are now just one point behind Liverpool with a game in hand.\n\nCity played without a recognised striker against Graham Potter's Brighton but despite not being at their best in soggy Manchester, eventually had just enough to beat the well-organised visitors.\n\nThe home side dominated possession in the early stages without creating much of note and Brighton carried an intermittent threat on the break.\n\nCity had a golden chance to take an early lead when the impressive Kevin De Bruyne was put through by Ilkay Gundogan but goalkeeper Robert Sanchez blocked the Belgian's shot right-footed shot from close range.\n\nBrighton's Leandro Trossard had a chance to test the returning Ederson in the City goal but he bent his shot wide.\n\nAs City found their rhythm, Joel Veltman reacted well to clear before Foden could poke the ball in the net and De Bruyne had another chance five minutes from half-time after a swift break but his powerful shot was well saved.\n\nCity's pressure finally told in the 44th minute. Foden received the ball from De Bruyne on the left of the attack.\n\nThe 20-year-old wriggled past two Brighton defenders and stroked the ball inside the near post from the edge of the box.\n\nIt was the England international's eighth goal of the season -- he is City's top-scorer in all competitions this campaign.\n\nNo player has more assists in all competitions than De Bruyne, with 14.\n\nThe goal meant Brighton had to change their game plan for the second half.\n\nRiyad Mahrez should have doubled the lead in the 58th minute, sending his left-footed shot wide after being put through.\n\nMoments later City again went close. Gundogan forced a good save from Sanchez and the rebound fell to Bernardo Silva, who turned and thumped a shot against the woodwork.\n\nBrighton's goal was leading a charmed life and Sanchez denied Joao Cancello and De Bruyne as the home side kept probing.\n\nBut City lacked the control they had in the first half and never looked entirely comfortable with such a narrow lead.\n\nBrighton engineered some promising situations but failed to properly test Ederson.\n\nDe Bruyne won a late penalty after Sanchez brought him down but substitute Raheem Sterling blazed his spot-kick over the bar.\n\nThe win means City are now unbeaten in their 14 games in all competitions and have won seven in a row.\n\nGuardiola's team have largely brushed off the absences of a number of players as a result of various coronavirus issues.\n\nSergio Aguero missed out as he continues his period in self-isolation after being identified as a close contact of someone who tested positive for coroanavirus.\n\nBut Ederson was back in goal following a spell on the sidelines after testing positive for Covid-19 and Gabriel Jesus, who also contracted the virus, appeared as a second-half substitute.\n\nAs it stands, City are third in the table, four points behind the leaders Manchester United. City have one game in hand over their crosstown rivals.\n\nIn the London derby, Ivan Cavaleiro scored 15 minutes from time to rescue a 1-1 draw for Fulham who were playing away to Spurs.\n\nHarry Kane had put the hosts ahead in the first half.\n\nTottenham have won just two of their last eight league matches and sit in sixth place.

    "content": "China reported its biggest daily jump in new Covid-19 cases in more than 10 months as infections in northeastern Heilongjiang province nearly tripled, underscoring the growing threat ahead of a major national holiday.\n\nThe National Health Commission said in a statement that 138 new Covid-19 cases were reported on January 13, up from 115 cases a day earlier and marking the highest jump since March 5. China also reported one new death, marking the first increase in the death toll since mid-May.\n\nThe commission said 124 of the new cases were local infections, 81 of which were reported in Hebei province surrounding Beijing and 43 in northeastern Heilongjiang province.\n\nThough the daily increases in Covid-19 cases in recent days remain a small fraction of what the country saw at the height of the pandemic in early 2020, China put more than 28 million people under home quarantine in January as part of an aggressive package of measures designed to curb the spread of the disease.\n\nThe new wave of infections comes ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their home towns. Covid-19's resurgence has already prompted some provinces to discourage travel, which could lead to reduced travel and dampen consumption during the long break.\n\nHeilongjiang's health authority on Thursday encouraged 37.5 million residents to spend the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays in the province and refrain from unnecessary travel.\n\nThe number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 78 from 38 a day earlier.\n\nThe total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mainland China now stands at 87,844, while the death toll rose by one to 4,635.

    "content": "An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organisation arrived on Thursday in China's central city of Wuhan to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus that sparked the pandemic, state television said.\n\nThe team arrived late in the morning on a budget airline from Singapore and was expected to head into two weeks of quarantine. They had been set to arrive earlier this month, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the agency's chief.\n\nThe United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of its initial outbreak a year ago, has called for a \"transparent\" WHO-led investigation and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts have done the first phase of research.\n\nThe team arrived as China battles a resurgence of cases in its northeast after managing for months to nearly stamp out domestic infections.\n\nPeter Ben Embarek, the WHO's top expert on animal diseases that cross to other species, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July, is leading the 10 independent experts, a WHO spokesman said.\n\nHung Nguyen, a Vietnamese biologist who is part of the 10-member team, told Reuters that he did not expect any restrictions on the group's work in China, but cautioned against finding firm answers.\n\nAfter completing quarantine, the team will spend two weeks interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market in Wuhan where the new pathogen is believed to have emerged, Hung added.\n\nThe team would mainly stay in Wuhan, he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday during a stopover in Singapore.\n\nLast week, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Gheybreyesus said he was \"very disappointed\" that China had still not authorised the team's entry for the long-awaited mission, but on Monday he welcomed its announcement of their planned arrival.\n\n\"What we would like to do with the international team and counterparts in China is to go back in the Wuhan environment, re-interview in-depth the initial cases, try to find other cases that were not detected at that time and try to see if we can push back the history of the first cases,\" Ben Embarek said in November.\n\nChina has been pushing a narrative via state media that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.\n\n\"We are looking for the answers here that may save us in future, not culprits and not people to blame,\" the WHO's top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, told reporters this week, adding that the WHO was willing to go \"anywhere and everywhere\" to find out how the virus emerged.\n\nTeam member Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, said last month it was too soon to say whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus had jumped directly from bats to humans or had an intermediate animal host.\n\n\"At this stage what I think we need is a very open mind when trying to step back into the events that led eventually to this pandemic,\" she told reporters.

They may not produce 50 percent efficacy or even lower,\" he said.\n\n\"We advise the government to review the data... There are a lot of choices, at least two, one is AstraZeneca, one is BioNTech vaccine,\" he said.\n\nHe told RTHK's Wendy Wong the Sinovac vaccine could be used by young and healthy people instead.\n\n\"Young people have strong immune systems. Even though the efficacy [of the Sinovac vaccine] is low, they still can keep 50 percent,\" he said.\n\n\"If you look at the data, the efficacy can go up to 60 percent. That's why we recommend the younger people to take the Sinovac vaccine,\" he said.\n\nVaccination centres across the city are expected to start operating next month to first give jabs to at-risk groups, including elderly people, medical workers and patients with chronic illnesses.",

He said this is because the Sinovac jabs are easier to handle than the ones developed by BioNTech, which need to be kept at very low temperatures and require a special dilution procedure before they can be administered.\n\n\"If only the BioNTech shots arrive next month, we will vaccinate people slowly,\" he said.\n\n\"So whether the Sinovac vaccines can be approved and arrive in Hong Kong soon will have a great impact on our vaccination plan.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he said the benefits of getting vaccinated should be highlighted, suggesting that close contacts of confirmed patients could be exempt from quarantine if they have been vaccinated and have tested negative for the virus.",

    "content": "The bunkering industry has called on the government to relax quarantine measures for incoming vessels and offer a HK$32 million lifeline for the sector hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe trade said sales volume has dropped by 70 percent since the outbreak began a year ago, resulting in a sharp drop in income for about 1,000 workers operating 160 bunker tanks.\n\nIt also said the industry has not benefitted from any rounds of anti-epidemic funds given out by the government so far.\n\nThe trade is seeking HK$200,000 in relief for each bunker tank.\n\nIn a protest held by the trade at Victoria Harbour on Thursday, 18 boats displayed banners which said \"The government bans shipping without giving us subsidies\" and \"To say Hong Kong port is open is empty talk\".\n\nHong Kong ranks among the world’s top-five bunkering ports by volume but could lose its position because of the pandemic amid regional competition, according to transport sector legislator Frankie Yick.\n\nAmong the coronavirus restrictions facing the industry is requiring crews of fishing and cargo vessels to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival.\n\n“People are not allowed to come in right now, but the ships are still going around the world. So where do they go? They go to Taiwan, they go to Singapore for bunkering,\" he said.\n\n\"We don’t want them to leave Hong Kong as much as we can. Once they go, they find it could be even more convenient or it could be cheaper over there, so then they won’t come back. So this is the worry that we have.\"\n\nAddressing claims that foreign crews brought the virus, triggering the third wave of the pandemic, Yick insisted the industry has changed its way of fuelling, so no interaction with cross-border crew is needed.\n\n“According to their understanding, [the local crew] might have to go up to the ocean-going vessel to do the connection for the piping so to do the refuelling. I said, ‘No, it’s not the case.’ The hose is being lift up by means of the rope or chain, then the people on board of the ship will do the connection by themselves.\n\n“There are some transferal documents. They will use a basket to lower down from the boat. Then before they take it up, they spray alcohol to kill all that sort of virus before they pick it up by their own hands. I would say all the precautionary measures have been done, so the government should do some sort of rethinking,” Yick said.",

    "content": "New applications for unemployment benefits in the US rose sharply in the first week of 2021, with a surge of 181,000 - the biggest increase since the coronavirus pandemic began in March, the Labour Department said on Thursday.\n\nThe 965,000 new claims filed in the week ended January 9 was far worse than analysts expected and comes as the world's largest economy continues to reel from a recent spike in virus cases, which have forced states to restrict businesses again.\n\nIn addition, 284,470 people applied for benefits under a programme passed during the pandemic to help workers not normally eligible, bringing the total newly laid-off last week to more than 1.2 million.\n\n\"The restrictions imposed to combat the third Covid wave clearly have done great damage,\" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nBut since Congress approved a new pandemic relief package in late December, Shepherdson predicted claims would drop in coming weeks as new aid package revives businesses.\n\nAlso helping the situation is the ongoing rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, which offer the best hope for a return to normalcy, he said.\n\nNonetheless, the data shows the ongoing toll the pandemic has taken on employment, and since the pandemic began 10 months ago, weekly claim filings have remained above the worst single week of the 2008-2010 financial crisis.\n\nThe US government reported more than 18.4 million people were receiving some form of aid as of the week ended December 26, slightly less than the week prior, but still a huge amount.

They would then have to take a second test. (AFP)",

    "content": "Fearing Covid cases, lost profits and possible lockdowns, local governments and humming factories on the mainland are offering a slew of incentives to persuade workers not to go home for the Chinese New Year holiday in February.\n\nThis period usually sees the majority of the country's 280 million rural migrant workers, as well as millions of white-collar workers who live far from home, travel back to see family.\n\nThe rapid coronavirus spread during last year's holidays, however, trapped many workers in their villages for months and forced them into long quarantines when they finally returned to the cities.\n\nFactories were paralysed, industrial production plummeted, and workers lost weeks of income.\n\nCompanies usually pay more to those who work over the festival, but this year local governments and companies are hoping far more take up the offer.\n\nMost provinces have issued notices encouraging workers to stay in place, citing the importance of epidemic control as well as \"guaranteeing the stability of industrial and supply chains.\"\n\nIncentives include extra pay, prizes, entertainment, free New Year's eve banquets and staggered holiday arrangements.\n\nDemand for labour in some industries is already high. China's manufacturing recovery, fuelled in part by demand from Covid-constrained consumers abroad, has soared past expectations this year, with factories struggling to fill a shortage of blue-collar workers.\n\nA notice from the government of Ningbo, Zhejiang province, said a halt to production over Lunar New Year amid blistering foreign demand could \"cause companies huge losses.\"\n\nWhile it's yet to be seen how many workers stay put this year, the mainland's state planner said it expects \"markedly lower\" holiday travel than normal. Jiangxi province, a major source of migrant workers, expects travel to be around 60 percent of 2019.\n\nOne chemicals company in Zhejiang told local media 85 percent of its workers plan to stay this year, lured by double hourly pay and an extra 500 yuan (US$77) reward for full-time attendance over the festival period.\n\nIncreased mass travel at this time also heighten the risk of new coronavirus infections, which had otherwise been largely snuffed out across most of the country.\n\nChina reported its biggest daily jump in new Covid-19 cases in more than 10 months on Thursday as infections in Heilongjiang province nearly tripled. Twenty-eight million people have been put under home quarantine in northern provinces.\n\nWang Zhishen, who works at a container factory in Dongguan, said he will probably stay there if his factory remains open, despite having already purchased a train ticket home to Gansu province, 2,000 kilometres away.\n\n\"What if you get unlucky and get infected on the road back home? Then your whole family might get sick,\" he said.\n\n\"If my factory is not going to be closed over the holiday, I think I'll just stay in Dongguan. Going home is too risky.\"\n\nFor some, especially those who don't have employers who can offer prizes and guarantee work over the holidays, reuniting with families is still worth the risk.\n\nAt Beijing Railway Station this week, a 64-year-old migrant worker surnamed Wang, who works as a construction worker in the capital, was rushing back to his village in eastern Shandong province before it enters lockdown.\n\n\"There's no other way. We have to get back before then. We've got family back home.\" he said, after arriving at the station seven hours before his train leaves Beijing. (Reuters)",

There are infection risks. So we’ve decided to expand the mandatory tests in a bid to cut off the transmission chain of the virus as quickly as possible and achieve zero infection in the area,” Chan explained.\n\nOfficers who can speak Nepalese, Urdu and other languages will visit the buildings in question and offer support for people from ethnic minority communities, she said.\n\nChan also encouraged other residents in the district, who are not covered by the mandatory testing order, to get tested as soon as possible.\n\nHealth authorities say more than 80 Covid infections have been recorded in the Yau Tsim Mong district in the past two weeks, with an outbreak involving more than 20 residents at an old tenement building on Reclamation Street.\n\nSpeaking on an RTHK programme earlier on Friday, Vincent Cheng from the DAB party said the authorities had been too slow to evacuate residents of the building when the first cases emerged.\n\nCheng said officials should consider public housing estates and old tenement buildings differently when carrying out mandatory testing.\n\n\"Currently, residents living in public housing buildings are required to undergo mandatory testing as soon as cases are reported from two different apartments. But there are hundreds of units in one public housing block... whereas there are only six or seven floors in an old tenement building. So I think the threshold for mandatory testing should be lowered there,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, Vincent Ho, said misconnected drainage pipes at old tenement buildings are common, and \"hazardous\" as they can help the spread of the virus.\n\nHe inspected the exterior walls of the Covid-hit block on Reclamation Street and said he suspected that additional toilets have been retrofitted to subdivided flats there.\n\n\"I can notice that there are a lot of additional pipes extended and connected to a few more toilets. This would be a hazardous situation particularly when the pipes are not properly connected,\" he said.",

Ping An Insurance soared 3.5 percent. ICBC jumped three percent. China Construction Bank advanced 1.8 percent.\n\nThe most heavily traded stock on the index was Xiaomi, which tumbled 10.3 percent after Washington added the mainland smartphone maker to a blacklist, a move that will force American investors to divest holdings of its shares.\n\nAnother firm called out by Washington, CNOOC, slid 1.1 percent, after the US said it had “repeatedly harassed and threatened offshore oil and gas exploration and extraction” in the South China Sea, with US groups now banned from selling their products to the mainland oil giant.\n\nMarkets across the border finished mixed as the country was gripped by a rise in domestic Covid cases. The Shanghai Composite Index was flat, but the blue-chip CSI300 index slid 0.2 percent. And the Shenzhen Composite index put on 0.3 percent.\n\nAround the region, Japan’s Nikkei snapped a five-day winning streak to close 0.6 percent lower. The Kospi in Seoul slumped two percent.

Many were required to pay back benefits totalling tens of thousands of euros.\n\nTax officials were also revealed to have carried out \"racial profiling\" of 11,00 people based on their dual nationality, including some of those hit by the false benefit fraud accusations.\n\nThe Dutch government announced at least 30,000 euros in compensation for each parent who was wrongly accused but it has not been enough to silence the growing clamour over the scandal.

It took less than four months after that to reach the next million.\n\n“Behind this terrible number are names and faces – the smile that will now only be a memory, the seat forever empty at the dinner table, the room that echoes with the silence of a loved one,\" said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.

But in an indication the issue might go beyond Europe, Canada's government said it was also affected.\n\nLine Fedders, a spokeswoman for Pfizer Denmark, said that to meet the new 2 billion dose target Pfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, which “presupposes adaptation of facilities and processes at the factory which requires new quality tests and approvals from the authorities.”\n\n“As a consequence, fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February,” she said.\n\n“This temporary reduction will affect all European countries,” she said in a statement.\n\nGermany’s Health Ministry said on Friday Pfizer had informed the European Commission, which was responsible for ordering vaccines from the company, that it won’t be able to fulfill all of the promised deliveries in the coming three to four weeks.\n\nThe ministry said German officials took note of the unexpected announcement by the Commission \"with regret” because the company had made binding delivery commitments by mid-February.\n\n“The federal and state governments expect the EU Commission to provide clarity and certainty as soon as possible in negotiations with Pfizer about further deliveries and delivery dates,” the statement said.\n\nThe Commission sealed the vaccine deals on behalf of all 27 member states, but is not responsible for the timetable and deliveries.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had “immediately called the CEO of Pfizer.”\n\n“He reassured me that all guaranteed doses of the first quarter will be delivered in the first quarter. He is personally on the case on reducing the delay period and to make sure that they will catch up as soon as possible,” von der Leyen said.\n\nEarlier on Friday Commission health policy spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker said deliveries are made on the basis of purchase orders and specific contracts that are concluded between the member states and the companies.\n\n\"The specificities of these arrangements are laid down in these purchase orders or contracts,” he said.\n\nThe Commission has secured up to 600 million extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine that's produced in partnership with Germany's BioNTech.\n\nPfizer’s Belgian plant supplies all shots delivered outside the United States, including Canada where procurement minister Anita Anand said Friday that the US drug-maker is temporarily reducing deliveries because of issues with its European production lines. While the company said it still was able to deliver four million doses by the end of March, that is no longer guaranteed, she said.\n\nCanadian officials said the reduction means Canada’s vaccine shipments will be cut in half for the next month.\n\nThe country has received just 380,000 doses of the vaccine so far and was supposed to get another 400,000 this month, and is expecting almost two million doses in February.\n\nNorwegian authorities also said on Friday they had been notified by Pfizer about the reduction that will start next week as the company raises its annual dose target from the current 1.3 billion.\n\n“We had predicted 43,875 vaccine doses from Pfizer in week 3. Now it seems that we get 36,075 doses,” said Geir Bukholm, director of infection control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.\n\n”The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead if there is a need for this,” he said.\n\nIn Finland, broadcaster YLE said the delay would cause domestic delivery problems at the end of January and the beginning of February.\n\nDanish officials expressed concern.\n\n“We are in a race with coronavirus and the new more contagious virus variant,\" Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said. \"Therefore, we take the decline in deliveries very seriously.”\n\nHenrik Ullum, head of Statens Serum Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of the coronavirus in Denmark, said he expected the development to mean that \"in the coming time we can vaccinate fewer than first assumed.” (AP)",

At Wells Fargo, profits edged up four percent to US$3.0 billion as revenues fell 10 percent.\n\nWall Street pushed all three institutions, with shares of JPMorgan falling 1.2 percent to US$138.64 at the close, Citigroup sinking 6.9 percent to US$64.23 and Wells Fargo diving 7.8 percent to US$32.04.

Of those cases, 115 were local infections, 90 of which were in Hebei province surrounding Beijing that has been hit hardest in the latest wave.\n\nAnother 23 cases were found in northeastern Heilongjiang province while two cases were reported in Beijing.\n\nTotal case numbers remain well below what China saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020, but concerns about a new country-wide wave are growing with a major national holiday a month away and estimates of 296 million railway passenger trips during the Lunar New Year break.\n\nThis surge comes as a World Health Organisation-led (WHO) team of investigators are in quarantine in the city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged in late 2019. The team aims to investigate the origins of the pandemic that has now killed nearly 2 million people worldwide.\n\nAuthorities in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, which already imposed a lockdown, said late on Friday that they had completed two rounds of testing for Covid-19 and had tested over 10 million people, finding 247 positive cases in the process. Of these, 217 were in the city's Gaocheng district.\n\nThe health commission also on Saturday reported that 79 new asymptomatic patients, who it does not classify as confirmed cases, were found on Friday compared to 66 a day earlier.\n\nThe total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland now stands at 88,118, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,635.

It's also ordered the same number of doses from AstraZeneca and SinoVac, and officials say they also plan to buy doses from a fourth manufacturer.\n\nHui, a Chinese University professor, added that one issue the panel will seek answers on is reports from Norway that 23 frail, elderly people died after receiving the vaccine.\n\n\"We want to actually see the information directly provided from the company to see if the cause of death was actually directly related to the vaccine or due to other causes,\" he said.\n\nHe said they will ask the company to provide more information over the deaths if they can't find it in the data provided.\n\nIf all goes smoothly, Hui said jabs could begin late next month, after the Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nThe convenor of the Advisory Panel on Covid-19 Vaccines, Professor Wallace Lau, added that he has learned that the government is planning to mobilise dentists and pharmacists in providing the jabs.\n\nSpeaking on a radio programme, another medical expert, the University of Hong Kong's Ivan Hung, said those who got vaccinated may also be required to mark down any side effects in a diary.\n\nHung said authorities may require people to jot down if they have any severe symptoms, fever or pain on their wounds following inoculation, so officials can gather data on the vaccines and decide whether there's a need to halt the programme when necessary.",

Nepalese climbers finally reached the summit of Mt K2 this afternoon at 17:00 local time.\"\n\nBut the success was overshadowed by the death of a Spanish climber, Sergi Mingote, lower down the mountain.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez described him as a \"great sportsman\" on Twitter, writing: \"He wanted to keep on making history... and a tragic accident ended his life.\"\n\nThe Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement that the climber fell while descending to Base Camp shortly before 4 pm.\n\nSecretary Karrar Haidri added the club was helping to coordinate the evacuation of the body, but with weather conditions expected to be poor overnight, it would be done on Sunday morning.\n\nThe name \"Savage Mountain\" comes from the punishing conditions there -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to minus 60 degrees Celsius.\n\nSince the maiden attempt in 1987-1988, just a handful of winter expeditions have been tried on the storied 8,611-metre peak in the Karakoram range along the Chinese border.\n\nNone had got higher than 7,650 metres until Saturday, when the good conditions allowed the successful team to push ahead.\n\nThe 10 Nepali climbers had earlier been spread across different teams, but formed a new group in order to claim the feat in Nepal's name.\n\nDespite being famed for their climbing expertise, there has never before been a Nepali climber on the first winter ascent of a peak over 8,000 metres.\n\nOne of the triumphant climbers, Nirmal Purja, who is also known as Nimsdai, described it as a \"very special moment\".\n\n\"The whole team waited 10m below the summit to form a group then stepped onto the summit together whilst singing our Nepalese National Anthem,\" wrote Purja in a social media post.\n\n\"We are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible.\"\n\nAt least one of the climbers, Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, had planned to reach the summit without using oxygen.\n\nThe news sparked joy throughout Nepal, long used to watching foreign climbers seize the records.\n\n\"For decades, Nepalis have assisted foreigners to reach the summits of the Himalayas, but we've not been getting the recognition we deserve,\" said renowned Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa, who has climbed Everest a record 24 times.\n\n\"The spotlight has always been on foreign climbers. It is wonderful that today on K2 ten Nepalis have made history and shown our bravery and strength.\"\n\nNepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas from the valleys around Everest, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas for bearing huge risks to carry equipment and food, fix ropes and repair ladders.\n\n\"Sherpas are top climbers of the world, and it is a proud moment for us. But reaching the summit is only the first half. We hope now that they can all make it back down safely,\" warned Ang Tshering Sherpa, the former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.\n\nOne of the final technical difficulties to be overcome by the group was the dreaded \"bottleneck\", a narrow and steep passage where 11 people were killed in August 2008 in K2's worst known tragedy.\n\nMany climbers have died trying to reach the summit, while others were killed on the dangerous descent.\n\nLockdowns and travel bans sparked by the coronavirus pandemic meant the summer climbing season last year was a bust in most of the popular climbing destinations in the region, such as Nepal.\n\nWith Pakistan's borders open and few other places to go, this winter an unprecedented four teams totalling around 60 climbers converged on the mountain, more than all previous expeditions put together.\n\nUnlike Mount Everest, which has been topped by thousands of climbers young and old, K2 is a much lonelier place.\n\nNorthern Pakistan is home to some of the world's tallest mountains, including K2 in the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nNestled between the western end of the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush mountains and the Karakoram range, Gilgit-Baltistan has 18 of the world's 50 highest peaks.

    "content": "A medical expert has warned that Hong Kong will not achieve \"herd immunity\" against the coronavirus unless it is able to provide five million people with vaccines, about 80 per cent of the population.\n\nSpeaking on RTHK's Letter to Hong Kong programme, Dr Alvin Chan, a co-chairman of the advisory committee on communicable diseases and a council member of the Medical Association, said the task was daunting and required resolute leadership.\n\n\"For mass vaccination to succeed, the government must try its best to educate the public about the need for vaccination; and to fend off misconceptions and false messages, especially the fallacies wrapped in pseudoscience, denouncing the vaccines,\" he said.\n\n\"The choice of vaccines should, of course, be based on published peer reviewed scientific research data, rather than emotional or political considerations.\"\n\nThe government has ordered 7.5 million doses each of three vaccines, provided by Sinovac, BioNTech and AstraZeneca. It said people would have a choice of vaccines, subject to their availability at a particular time and venue.\n\nChan also urged the government to look into the benefits of vitamin D in fighting the pandemic. He said research had shown that the vitamin could be helpful in preventing and managing Covid-19.\n\n\"As incentives for the mass vaccination programme, the government could consider giving out Vitamin D supplement for all Covid-19 vaccinees when they leave the venues, together with educational materials on the vital role of Vitamin D in our immune system, and a vaccination certificate or code, good for job applications, travelling, reopening of restaurants, gyms, theatres and businesses alike,\" he said.\n\n\"Vaccination is not 100 percent protection. We need to continue proper masking, social distancing, hand hygiene, and daily Vitamin D fortification.",

And millions of Americans who back Trump refuse to recognise Biden as the legitimate president.\n\nBiden this week unveiled plans to seek US$1.9 trillion to revive the economy through new stimulus payments and other aid, and plans a blitz to accelerate America's stumbling Covid vaccine rollout effort.\n\nOn Inauguration Day Biden, as previously promised, will sign orders including ones for the US to rejoin the Paris climate accord and reverse Trump's ban on entry of people from certain Muslim majority countries, Klain said.\n\n\"President-elect Biden will take action – not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration – but also to start moving our country forward,\" Klain said.

    "content": "Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny took off on a plane bound for Moscow on Sunday for the first time since he was poisoned last summer, despite Russian authorities' stated desire to arrest him and potentially jail him for years.\n\nNavalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent domestic critics, was flown to Berlin in August for emergency medical treatment after being poisoned with what German tests showed was a Novichok nerve agent.\n\nHe announced his decision to return from Germany on Wednesday, and a day later Moscow's prison service said it would do everything to arrest him once he returned, accusing him of flouting the terms of a suspended prison sentence for embezzlement, a 2014 case he says was trumped up.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who boarded a plane in Berlin at the last minute from a car sitting on the tarmac, hence avoiding other passengers, said he was delighted to be flying home and made light of the risk of being arrested.\n\n\"This is the best moment in the last five months,\" he told reporters who had bought seats on the same plane carrying him back to Moscow. \"I feel great. Finally, I'm returning to my home town.\"\n\nHe said he didn't think he would be arrested, calling himself an innocent person.\n\n\"What do I need to be afraid of? What bad thing can happen to me in Russia?\" he added. \"I feel like a citizen of Russia who has every right to return,\" he added.\n\nHe was accompanied by his wife Yulia, and his spokeswoman.\n\nNavalny, who is hoping for success in parliamentary elections in September, faces potential trouble in three other criminal cases too, all of which he says are politically motivated.\n\nHis return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests and punitive Western action by turning him into a political martyr. Or do nothing and risk looking weak in the eyes of Kremlin hardliners.\n\nHe is expected to arrive in Moscow at 1620 GMT.\n\nThe opposition politician, who says he has nearly fully recovered, says Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin denies involvement, says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and that he is free to return to Russia.\n\nNavalny says the Kremlin is afraid of him. The Kremlin, which only refers to him as the \"Berlin patient,\" laughs that off. Putin allies point to opinion polls that show the Russian leader is far more popular than Navalny, whom they call a blogger rather than a politician.\n\nNavalny took a flight operated by Russian airline Pobeda, owned by state-controlled Aeroflot.\n\nHis supporters plan to meet him at Moscow's Vnukovo airport despite a forecast of bitterly cold minus 20 Celsius weather and over 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital.\n\nSo far, at least 2,000 people have used a Facebook page to say they plan to be there, with another 6,000 expressing an interest. Pro-Kremlin activists are also expected to turn up.\n\nThe Moscow prosecutor's office, which says it has officially warned 15 pro-Navalny organisers, has said the event is illegal because it is not sanctioned by the authorities. That means that people who turn up could be detained, fined or jailed.\n\nReuters reporters saw a heavy police presence at the airport with dozens of police trucks.\n\nCiting COVID-19 restrictions, the airport has said it will not allow media inside.

    "content": "Police detained prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on arrival in Moscow on Sunday after he flew home to Russia from Germany for the first time since he was poisoned last summer, triggering a political clash with the West.\n\nThe move, which could see Navalny jailed for 3.5 years for allegedly flouting the terms of a suspended prison sentence, may reignite political pressure on the West to tighten sanctions on Russia, especially against an US$11.6 billion project to build a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.\n\nIn a case that drew wide international attention, Navalny was poisoned last summer by what German military tests showed was a Novichok nerve agent, a version of events the Kremlin rejects.\n\nNavalny recovered in Germany and after he said last week he planned to return home, the Moscow prison service (FSIN) said it would do everything to arrest him once he returned, accusing him of flouting the terms of a suspended prison sentence for embezzlement, a 2014 case he says was trumped up.\n\nBut the 44-year-old opposition politician laughed and joked with journalists on his plane, saying he was not afraid and did not believe he would be arrested.\n\nFour masked police officers asked Navalny to accompany him at passport control at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, before he had formally entered Russia. They did not explain why. Navalny, after kissing his wife Yulia on the cheek, walked away with them.\n\nNavalny's supporters have said incarcerating one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent domestic critics could turn him into a Nelson Mandela-like figure and an increasingly popular symbol of resistance to the Kremlin.\n\nThe Kremlin, which only refers to him as the \"Berlin patient,\" laughs that off. Putin allies point to opinion polls that show the Russian leader is far more popular than Navalny, whom they call a blogger rather than a politician.\n\nMinutes before he was detained, Navalny had said: \"I am not afraid. I know that I am right. I know all the criminal cases against me are fabricated.\"\n\nNavalny says Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin denies involvement. It says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned.\n\nNavalny's plane from Berlin was diverted to Sheremetyevo airport from another Moscow airport at the last minute for a technical reason in an apparent effort by authorities to thwart journalists and supporters greeting him.\n\nMoscow's FSIN said in a statement Navalny had been detained due to the alleged violations of his suspended prison sentence and would be held in custody until a court hearing later this month that will rule whether to convert his suspended sentence into a real 3.5 jail term.\n\nNavalny faces potential trouble in three other criminal cases too, all of which he says are politically motivated.\n\nHis arrest drew immediate condemnation abroad.\n\nU.S. President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Twitter: \"Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable.\"\n\nU.S. opposition to the gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, is bi-partisan and Biden has described the pipeline as a “bad deal” for Europe.\n\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, demanded Navalny's immediate release. European Union member Lithuania said on Sunday it would ask the European Union to swiftly impose new sanctions on Russia, and Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said he wanted the EU to discuss possible sanctions.\n\nRussian authorities will be watching closely in coming days to see if Navalny's detention triggers big public protests.\n\nTatiana Stanovaya, head of political analysis firm R.Politik, said his arrest showed Kremlin hardliners were in the ascendancy.\n\n\"He's (Navalny's) gone from being a petty hooligan to then being an enemy that they need to humiliate, crush and punish,\" she wrote on messaging app Telegram.\n\nNavalny, joined by his wife, spokeswoman and lawyer, flew from Berlin on a flight operated by Russian airline Pobeda, owned by state-controlled Aeroflot.\n\nHis supporters gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport despite bitterly cold weather and over 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital.\n\nThe authorities' decision to switch airports to Sheremetyevo airport thwarted them.\n\nOVD-Info, a monitoring group, said police had detained 53 people in Moscow and five in St Petersburg.\n\nThe Moscow prosecutor's office, which had officially warned 15 pro-Navalny organisers, had said meeting him en masse was illegal because it was not sanctioned by the authorities.

    "content": "Manchester City moved up to second in the English Premier League and within two points of leaders Manchester United as John Stones scored twice in a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace.\n\nCity can go top if they win their game in hand over their local rivals and took full advantage of dropped points for both their biggest title challengers after United and Liverpool played out a disappointing 0-0 draw earlier on Sunday.\n\nIlkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling also produced stunning finishes as Pep Guardiola's men recorded an eighth straight win.\n\nDespite not hitting the heights of back-to-back league titles under Guardiola between 2017 and 2019, City are now unbeaten in 15 games to move into pole position.\n\nA 12th clean sheet in that 15-game run again set the platform as City's forwards have struggled to match their free-scoring form of old.\n\nStones's partnership with Ruben Dias has been key to most of those shutouts and the England defender , after waiting five seasons for his first Premier League goal since joining City, got two in the one game.\n\nKevin De Bruyne registered his 100th City assist with the outside of his right foot for Stones to nod home from close range to open the scoring on 26 minutes.\n\nPalace had taken four points from their last two trips to the Etihad, but without the injured Wilfried Zaha offered barely any attacking threat as the Eagles remain 13th in the table.\n\nWith Gabriel Jesus and Sterling short on goals and Sergio Aguero absent after coming into close contact with a positive coronavirus case, Gundogan's goalscoring form of late has been a major factor in City's revival.\n\nThe German midfielder curled home his fourth goal in seven games into the top corner 11 minutes into the second-half to end any doubt over the outcome.\n\nStones then swept home his second of the night on the rebound after Vicente Guaita saved from Dias's initial powerful header.\n\nGuardiola could then afford the luxury of handing De Bruyne and Gundogan a rare rest for the final 20 minutes ahead of Aston Villa's visit on Wednesday.\n\nSterling blazed a penalty over the bar late on in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Brighton when handed the responsibility by De Bruyne.\n\nWith the Belgian off the field, Sterling got another chance from a set-piece outside the box and this time curled a brilliant free-kick into the top corner two minutes from time to round off a perfect day for City.

He said the government should also examine the pipes of old buildings there to prevent the virus from being spread via the sewage system.\n\nMore than 7,000 resident in the Yau Ma Tei/Jordan area have undergone tests in the past two days.",

    "content": "The government on Monday was urged to offer more support to people who have recovered from Covid-19, after a survey suggested that a majority of those who end up in hospital are left with at least one persistent symptom of the disease.\n\nResearchers from Chinese University followed up on 30 people who were in hospital with Covid-19 between February and April last year and whose bodies were later found to be clear of the virus.\n\nEighty percent reported that six months after they were released from hospital they still had at least one persistent symptom, such as fatigue, poor memory, sleeping problems, breathing difficulties and hair loss.\n\nOne of the researchers, Dr Joyce Mak, said the recovered patients were struggling with symptoms that were seriously affecting their quality of life.\n\n\"Some said they could no longer do what they did regularly before they got Covid, like hiking. They have become home-bound,\" she said.\n\nAnother researcher, Professor Ng Siew-chien, urged authorities to continue assessing the health condition of coronavirus patients discharged from hospital.\n\n\"The first is psychological support. It's very important. These patients, once they recovered, should not just be left. They still need certain assessments about their health,\" she said.\n\nNg said it is believed that the virus disrupts the balance of good and bad bacteria in people's guts, leading to the persistent symptoms.\n\n\"Our gut microbiota is central in regulating our immune system, our brain functions and different organs as well. So we believe that there seems to be a very strong association between the symptoms and the guts,\" she said.\n\n\"The easiest and non-invasive way, if they have microbiota imbalance, would be to restore this balance through certain supplementation or diet or other nutritional things. That may have a chance to reduce their symptoms.",

In this second round, we have increased the number of hotels that charge a low-end price, meaning less than a thousand dollars and specifically less than 500 dollars a night,” he said.\n\n“As regards to the other four hotels that have decided to withdraw from the scheme, it’s because of their own considerations and commercial reasons and all that. I would not comment on that.”\n\nMore than 8,000 of the 10,000 hotel rooms available will cost less than HK$1,000 a night.\n\nAbout 2,800 rooms will cost less than HK$500 a night, with Nip saying this is double the number currently available in that price range.\n\nThe four hotels that will no longer be on the list are Eco Tree Hotel in Central, Mojo Nomad Aberdeen Hotel, The Luxe Manor in Tsim Sha Tsui and O’ Hotel in Kowloon City.\n\nThey have been replaced by IW Hotel in Kowloon City, Silka Far East Hotel in Tsuen Wan, Silka Seaview in Yau Ma Tei and Ovolo Southside.",

One hundred and two are locally acquired, including a family of eight. Forty-two patients contracted the virus via unknown sources.\n\nDr Chuang Shuk-kwan of the Centre for Health Protection said 28 of the latest cases came from buildings in Yau Ma Tei and Jordan that are now under a mandatory coronavirus testing order.\n\nResidents of seven more buildings in the area – on Shanghai Street, Reclamation Street, Temple Street, Canton Road and Battery Street – are ordered to undergo mandatory testing after cases were reported from their blocks.\n\nChuang warned of an exponential rise in cases.\n\n“The high number partly is due to the result of compulsory testing which is expected. But the number is a bit high. This signifies that there’s still quite significant silent transmission in the community, especially in Yau Ma Tei area,” she said.\n\n“If any of these cases visited any high-risk area or are exposed to many people, there may be exponential increase as in previous outbreaks.”\n\nOfficials also said that based on their data, more than a quarter of some 600 Covid patients recorded since early January are of South Asian descent, and many of them live in Yau Ma Tei.\n\n“They usually live in quite crowded areas with close-knitted community, so they may spread the infection through the environmental contamination and also person-to-person interaction to their families and friends in the streets or in the parks,” Chuang said.\n\n“They may have some social gatherings such as smoking and drinking during the evenings and also other activities… they like to visit each other and they like to sleep over in each other’s home.”\n\nProfessor Ivan Hung, who heads the infectious diseases division at the Hong Kong University Department of Medicine, said the next several days will be key to the outbreak in Yau Ma Tei and Jordan.\n\n\"We have to see in the next two or three days if we are able to – you know, with the effective contact tracing -- contain the community outbreak to within 30 to 40 cases in the next few days, then hopefully the number of cases will come down because as a whole, I think, apart from this small community outbreak, the so-called fourth wave is very much under control right now,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, health authorities said a doctor who works at the intensive care unit in North District Hospital has tested preliminary positive for the virus. The Hospital Authority said the doctor performed intubation on a Covid patient earlier this month and was wearing full protective gear.\n\nAnd a partial evacuation has been ordered for residents of a public housing block in Chai Wan after about 10 cases were reported from five units in Hiu Fung House at Fung Wah Estate.\n\nThree of the flats end with the number \"13\" and are on different floors but face the same direction.\n\nAfter inspecting the building on Monday, Professor Yuen Kwok-yung of the University of Hong Kong said residents of unit 1213 fell ill first, followed by those in units 913 and 1113, where vent pipes had been altered.\n\nThat raised fears that the virus might have spread in a downward vertical direction.\n\nResidents of units ending with \"13\" on or below the 12th floor will be evacuated.",

We still need more information and data for their causes of death. We understand that they were all elderly, and they had multiple different medical conditions. We need to know whether the deaths were actually related to underlying problems or to the vaccines,\" said the panel's convenor, Wallace Lau.\n\nHe stressed that in the event that the panel later decides that the risks involved in using the jabs are bigger than previously thought, it could recommend that they be withdrawn.\n\nBioNTech/Fosun Pharma were reported to be the first to apply for their vaccine to be approved for emergency use in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SAR government has also ordered jabs from China's Sinovac, as well as a vaccine jointly developed by Oxford University and Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca.",

When Biden takes the oath of office, he will face a city under the protection of more than 20,000 National Guard soldiers.\n\nCheckpoints and large zones closed to ordinary citizens mean there will be only a smattering of guests. Similar lockdowns have been imposed at state capitol buildings around the country where local authorities fear provocations from right-wing groups ahead of the inauguration.\n\nTrump, who has still not congratulated Biden or invited him for the traditional tea visit in the Oval Office, has been largely out of the public eye since his supporters rampaged through Congress on January 6, triggering his historic second impeachment a week later.\n\nHis final Gallup poll as president on Monday showed him exiting with 34 percent approval, his record low. His overall average of 41 percent since taking office is also the lowest for any presidency's approval rating since Gallup began measuring in 1938.\n\nAccording to US media, one of Trump's final actions could be announced Tuesday at the latest: scores of pardons for convicted criminals.\n\nSpeculation is mounting over whether Trump will take the unprecedented and legally murky step of issuing himself and his children, who work as campaign and White House advisors, preemptive pardons.\n\nAccording to CNN and other outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency.

A lottery will be held to see who gets to keep the stalls, but authorities say they will work to make sure all bidders who won multiple stalls would be allocated at least one.\n\nNo charge will be levied.\n\nAuthorities will also go high-tech to implement crowd control measures.\n\nThe director for food and environmental hygiene Vivian Lau said each fair will be split up into smaller areas, and “infrared sensors will be installed at the entrance and exit of each individual enclosed area so that the number of persons could be computed, and if the capacity is exceed, an alert will be disseminated to the public on site, on a dedicated web page, and through radio [and] television if needed.”\n\nA 'traffic light' system will be implemented at the fairs to either allow, slow, or stop people entering specific zones.\n\nWhen an area is deemed to be full, people will have to queue up in waiting areas while being socially distanced.\n\nSophia Chan added that all flower vendors will be tested for Covid ahead of time; and must provide a list of all staff members to help contact tracing efforts if needed.\n\n“There are all these infection control measures, such as taking temperatures, controlling the crowds, as well as hand sanitiser and also social distancing measures… We believe that we have tried our best to lower the infection risk\" she said.\n\nThe secretary said that those going to the fairs will be invited to make use of the government's coronavirus contact-tracing \"Leave Home Safe\" app.\n\nThis will involve scanning a QR code so the system knows who is at the fairs and when.\n\nThe government recently said that the app would start recording users' whereabouts automatically in future.\n\nChan said the new arrangements strike a better balance between its anti-epidemic efforts, the interests of flower farmers, and the public's demand for fresh flowers for the festive season.",

Tens of millions have been put into home or centralised quarantine in Hebei, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces.\n\nSongyuan city in Jilin on Wednesday ordered a lockdown for the main urban area under its jurisdiction and began mass testing.

    "content": "The government said on Wednesday that it is prepared to further reduce the number of people to be allowed in the Lunar New Year flower markets if the coronavirus situation worsens, but insisted it doesn't plan to scrap the events altogether.\n\nThe director of food and environmental hygiene, Vivian Lau, made the remark a day after officials announced that the traditional new year fairs next month will go ahead with stringent crowd-control measures, just a little over a week after saying they would be cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\nLau said on an RTHK programme that the administration will keep a close eye on the pandemic situation.\n\n\"We will try our best to reduce the number of people in each zone. If, after risk assessments, we think it is still achievable and acceptable, we will try our best to carry out the current arrangement,\" she said.\n\nThe government has said each of the 15 fairs across the city would be split up into smaller areas, with a cap on the number of people allowed in at one time.\n\nLau said if there's a resurgence of cases, the number of visitors allowed in each zone could be further reduced.\n\nWhen asked whether she's worried too many people would turn up and the arrangements go against anti-epidemic measures, Lau said people should not stay at the markets for too long, and should \"buy quickly and sell quickly\".\n\nA local flower farmer surnamed Poon said on the same programme that the way the government disseminated information was chaotic, but at least now he could sell his flowers and reduce his losses.\n\nBut another caller, Mrs Tsui, said it's a bad idea to hold new year fairs this year.\n\n\"You think it's like buying vegetables? Those who buy flowers will compare the flowers... of course that will take time. So there must be chaos and crowds at the markets. I don't think the decision is right,\" she said.\n\nInfectious disease expert and government adviser David Hui said it's \"a little contradictory\" to push ahead with the flower markets while other social-distancing measures are in place, but believes it's a compromise to cater for the needs of flower vendors.\n\nHui called on people who visit the fairs to wear masks properly and clean their hands often.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump left the White House for the last time on Wednesday, skipping the inauguration of successor Joe Biden as the 46th US president in an extraordinary break with tradition.\n\nDrawing a curtain on the most tumultuous administration of modern times, Trump is being ousted by a polar opposite with the Democrat Biden intent on charting a new course to tackle Covid-19 and unite a splintered nation.\n\nA small crowd waved goodbye as Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet and boarded the Marine One helicopter shortly after 8:15 am (1315 GMT), for the short flight to the air base where they will continue to Florida on board Air Force One.\n\n\"I just want to say goodbye,\" Trump told the gathering, calling his time in office \"the honour of a lifetime.\"\n\nTrump will be at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when Biden, a 78-year-old former vice president, is sworn in at noon on the US Capitol's western front.\n\nBiden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office at the very spot where pro-Trump rioters clashed with police two weeks ago before storming Congress in a deadly insurrection.\n\nWhile a transition of power will occur much as it has for more than two centuries, this inauguration is unlike any other.\n\nOfficial Washington has taken on the dystopian look of an armed camp, protected by some 25,000 National Guard troops tasked with preventing any repeat of this month's attack.\n\nAnd with the pandemic raging, the general public is essentially barred from attending the swearing-in, leading to the unprecedented sight of an empty National Mall on Inauguration Day.\n\nWith the death toll soaring past 400,000, Biden on Tuesday led a powerful tribute to victims of Covid-19 as he arrived in Washington.\n\n\"It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,\" Biden said in sombre remarks in front of the Lincoln Memorial, once more stressing the need to unite the country after Trump's chaos.\n\nOn the Mall's grassy expanse, some 200,000 flags have been planted to represent the absent crowds at the inauguration.\n\nTrump broke days of silence on Tuesday with a pre-recorded farewell video address in which - for the first time - he asked Americans to \"pray\" for the success of the incoming administration.\n\nBut Trump has yet to personally congratulate Biden, who first ran for president in 1987, on his win, and the 11th-hour message followed months spent persuading his Republican followers that the Democrat cheated his way to election victory.\n\nIn one of his last acts before departing the White House, Trump issued scores of pardons to people convicted of crimes or facing charges, including several key allies.\n\nInfluential former Trump aide Steve Bannon - charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall, a flagship Trump policy - was among 73 people on a list released by the White House.\n\nHowever, neither Trump nor his relatives were listed, amid speculation he could use the legally dubious tactic of a preemptive pardon to fend off future charges.\n\nFormer Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.\n\nThe rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.\n\nTensions have soared on Capitol Hill, where the Senate is expected to put Trump on trial soon following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives over the Capitol riot.\n\nThe spectacle will clash with the opening days of Biden's tenure, as the new president seeks to swiftly confirm his Cabinet picks and push through ambitious legislation - including a US$1.9 trillion rescue package.\n\n\"We don't have a second to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face as a nation,\" Biden tweeted late on Tuesday.\n\n\"That's why after being sworn in tomorrow, I'll get right to work.\"\n\nHe plans to kick off his tenure by rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organisation, according to aides, who said Biden would sign 17 orders and actions just hours after being sworn in, setting new paths on immigration, the environment, Covid-19 and the economy.\n\nIn first-day moves, he will end Trump's much-assailed ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries and halt construction of the wall that Trump ordered on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, the aides said.\n\nTo symbolise the new spirit of unity, Biden has invited the two top senators - Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell - and other congressional leaders to attend a church service with him on Wednesday before the inauguration.\n\nOverseas leaders weighed in to mark the end of a presidency which has deviated from orthodox American foreign policy.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani hailed the White House departure of \"tyrant\" Trump, saying \"the ball is in America's court\" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran.\n\nAnd Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the inauguration would \"be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy,\" as well as \"the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.\" (AFP)",

Jack Charlton and Nobby Stiles died from dementia last year, while Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton has also been diagnosed with the condition.\n\nA host of former rugby union internationals announced in December they are planning legal action against their sport's authorities over the consequences of concussion.

He has promised immediate action, including a raft of executive orders on his first day in office.\n\nThe ceremony on Wednesday unfolded in front of a heavily fortified US Capitol, where a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building two weeks ago, enraged by his false claims that the election was stolen with millions of fraudulent votes.\n\nThe violence prompted the Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives to impeach Trump last week for an unprecedented second time.\n\nThousands of National Guard troops were called into the city after the siege, which left five people dead and briefly forced lawmakers into hiding. Instead of a throng of supporters, the National Mall on Wednesday was covered by nearly 200,000 flags and 56 pillars of light meant to represent people from US states and territories. (Reuters)",

Schools and non-essential shops are closed, social mixing and travel are restricted.\n\nA review of the measures is due in mid-February, with hopes that stay-at-home orders can begin to be lifted.\n\nNew cases have begun to fall after weeks of rises, with the number of fresh infections recorded over the last seven days down nearly a quarter.\n\nBut Vallance said the eventual easing of restrictions should not be done quickly, echoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week, who said it would not be an \"Open Sesame\" moment.\n\n\"This is going to be a slow release, monitoring carefully, understanding the effects,\" Vallance added.\n\nBritain's total Covid-19 death tally now stands at 91,470, with a further 33,355 new cases also reported over Tuesday, taking the total number of infections to nearly 3.5 million.

    "content": "Beijing is touting a state programme that gives Taiwanese on the mainland priority for Covid-19 vaccines, prompting concern within Taiwan's government which sees it as the latest mainland tool to win over the island's population.\n\nBeijing is making the free-of-charge offer at a time when Taipei has yet to begin vaccinations of its own, with mainland government departments and state media quoting Taiwanese on the mainland in support of the programme.\n\n\"This shows the mainland's warmth and affection towards us,\" a Taiwanese teacher surnamed Wang was quoted as saying in a post this month by China's United Front Work Department, which is in charge of co-opting overseas Chinese and non-communists.\n\nBeijing has for decades offered incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies to the estimated 400,000-strong Taiwanese business community on the mainland, but the move underscores a greater push to curry favour.\n\nWang Yang, the Communist Party's No. 4 leader, this week instructed government officials to offer Taiwanese comprehensive benefits in a bid to give \"a sense of gain\" among Taiwanese in aid of the \"reunification with the motherland\".\n\nIt is unclear how many Taiwanese on the mainland have been vaccinated but in Taiwan, officials are unnerved by the programme and say vaccines have become the latest frontline in Beijing's charm offensive.\n\n\"The tactic is to reinforce Taiwanese businessmen's allegiance towards the mainland and further add pressure to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,\" a Taiwan security official investigating the matter said.\n\nThe official was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.\n\nTaiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that vaccination is a matter for the medical profession and \"should not be used as political propaganda.\"\n\nTaiwanese should \"cautiously evaluate the safety and necessity\" of receiving vaccines on the mainland, it said, adding that it will continue to monitor the situation.\n\nTaiwan government officials have repeatedly reminded people of health \"risks\" related to Chinese vaccines and said those who get the vaccines on the mainland must still undergo 14-day quarantine when returning to the island. Imports of the vaccines are banned.\n\nBeijing's Taiwan Affairs Office referred the media to recent remarks it made that Taiwan's government was spreading \"baseless concerns\" over the Chinese vaccines for \"political purposes\", and that China's vaccines were \"very safe\".\n\nWhile Taiwan has kept the pandemic well under control thanks to early and effective prevention methods, the government has come under increasing pressure amid a rare outbreak of domestically transmitted Covid-19 cases.\n\nTaiwan has ordered nearly 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, including 10 million from AstraZeneca, but none will start arriving until March at the earliest.

    "content": "The mainland plans to impose strict Covid testing requirements during the Lunar New Year holiday season, when tens of millions of people are expected to travel, as it battles the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.\n\nMillions of residents in Hebei province, Jilin province and Heilongjiang have been put into lockdown in recent weeks amid what is the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.\n\nAuthorities are asking people to stay home during the Lunar New Year holidays in February as part of the efforts to prevent another debilitating outbreak.\n\nA total of 144 new cases were reported on January 20, the National Health Commission said on Thursday, matching the total reported on January 14 and marking the highest number of daily infections since March 1. This still remains a fraction of what the mainland saw during the height of the outbreak in January-February 2020, however.\n\nOf the 126 new local infections, Heilongjiang accounted for 68 while Jilin reported 33. Hebei, which had so far seen the biggest spike in cases this month, reported 20 new cases, and Beijing reported two cases.\n\nThe number of new asymptomatic cases, which the mainland does not classify as confirmed infections, rose to 113 from 58 a day earlier.\n\nIn a notice posted online, the National Health Commission said people returning to rural areas from other provinces over the Lunar New Year period would have to produce a negative Covid-19 test taken within seven days.\n\nA majority of the mainland's 280 million rural migrant workers usually travel home to their villages at this time of year.\n\nThose that work with imported cold chain products, or quarantine facility workers, among other groups, would also have to produce a test, even if they remained in the same province, said the notice.\n\nRural areas' epidemic control, as well as infections spread via imported frozen goods, have been blamed by officials as weak links partially responsible for the current outbreaks.\n\nAn announcement from an NHC official during a Wednesday news conference had suggested everyone returning home would have to take a test. Xinhua News Agency then published an article urging officials to clarify details \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe official total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland now stands at 88,701, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.

    "content": "An advocacy group for ethnic minorities said on Thursday that local officials have to be more culturally sensitive, after comments by health authorities on the coronavirus outbreak in Yau Tsim Mong earlier this week left some people feeling targeted.\n\nMore than 180 coronavirus infections have been confirmed in the district over the past two weeks.\n\nAt the government’s regular Covid-19 press briefing on Monday, a Centre for Health Protection official gave a range of potential reasons for the outbreak, but also attributed infections to what he said were the cultural and social habits of the area’s ethnic minority residents.\n\nHong Kong Unison’s executive director, Phyllis Cheung, said the remarks were somewhat discriminatory against ethnic minorities.\n\nShe said many ethnic minority residents have a high awareness of health precautions; she said many have been wearing masks, and had decided to cancel religious activities.\n\nChief Executive Carrie Lam this week sought to clarify that authorities didn’t mean to suggest that the spread of Covid-19 is related to race. But Cheung said the incident shows that some government officials need to improve their cultural sensitivity.\n\nMeanwhile, a district councilor for Yau Tsim Mong, Frank Ho, said more and more ethnic minority residents have gone to take tests, after the government began providing more information in different languages.\n\nBut Ho said some residents are worried about the accuracy of the tests, after they heard of a case involving a Nepalese man who apparently twice tested negative for the virus before testing positive at a public hospital.\n\nHo said with more and more buildings coming under compulsory testing orders, it is important for coronavirus tests to be accurate.",

    "content": "A Wuhan doctor who was among the first to be infected with Covid-19 a year ago has called on Hong Kong people to put politics aside and take China-made vaccines, even as he accused mainland authorities of trying to cover up the pandemic at its onset.\n\nIn an interview with RTHK, Yu Changping, a member of a Covid-19 expert team in Hubei province, said authorities there \"made some mistakes\" when they failed to notify people of new infections in January last year.\n\nYu, 54, said that since the coronavirus was a new disease, it was not clear at the time how it was spreading, and mistakes were made because there were limits in terms of studying the virus at the beginning.\n\nThe respiratory disease specialist at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University said he did not know how or when he contracted the virus, but he saw some patients on January 8, 2020 and then started to experience symptoms.\n\nYu was admitted to hospital on January 17 and his condition quickly deteriorated. He eventually stayed in hospital for five weeks before his health slowly improved.\n\nThe mainland's top medical expert Zhong Nanshan made an announcement on January 20, 2020 that Covid-19 was spreading between people, but Yu said he and his colleagues knew about this some time before.\n\n\"If it wasn't spreading among people, why would so many people come to see the doctor? There were patients everywhere, so it was certainly spreading from human to human. It was just that words of ordinary people could not travel far,\" he said.\n\nYu said that frontline medics should have been able to directly report cases to Beijing via an infectious disease notification system set up after the Sars outbreak in 2003, but the system became a mere formality.\n\n\"I mentioned about the direct reporting system on Weibo, but this content was screened out... China's self-media is well-developed and people are free to speak, but there are some topics you should be careful about,\" he said.\n\nYu said he has now been inoculated against the virus with a vaccine manufactured on the mainland. He said Hong Kong people should also get China jabs, saying these are \"more reliable\" traditional inactivated virus vaccines, unlike vaccines developed by overseas drug manufacturers using more modern techniques.\n\n\"One has to promote political ideologies, but I feel there is too much of it. When it comes to fighting a pandemic and curing diseases ... there is too much politics,\" he said.\n\n\"Hong Kong people should get the mainland-made vaccines, because they are inactivated. They are made in a traditional way. Overseas RNA vaccines are made with new technologies, and there are a lot of uncertainties,\" he said.\n\nThe doctor also said that in the later stages of the outbreak, China performed well and was able to contain the virus in a short time.\n\nHe expressed confidence that China would not experience another massive outbreak, saying the government and the people now have the experience and the ability to control the situation.",

    "content": "A man who has come down with the coronavirus is urging the authorities to make sure their community testing services are up to standard, saying he and his three family members experienced delays in treatment because of false negative results.\n\nDilip Rai, a Nepalese who lives with his family on Reclamation Street in Jordan, started feeling unwell on January 9.\n\nHaving a sore throat and a slight headache, he gargled salt water, drank ginger lemon turmeric water and rested for three days.\n\nHe developed a fever on January 12, and went to see a private doctor the day after.\n\nThe doctor found that Rai’s sense of smell and taste was unaffected and told him that he may have had tonsillitis. Rai was prescribed some medication and supplements afterwards.\n\nBut his fever did not come down, so Rai went to the community testing centre in Yau Ma Tei to get tested on January 15. The result came back negative the next day.\n\nHe said he felt that staff at the testing centre didn’t collect his nasal and throat swabs properly at the time.\n\n“The way the test was conducted was very cursory,” he told RTHK's Jimmy Choi said, “the nasal swab that was supposed to go way back into the nose, they just touched the surface of my nostrils.”\n\nRai also said instead of taking a swab from the back of his throat, the staff only rubbed the swab around his mouth.\n\n“Is this it?” Rai said he had asked the staff at the time, but was told the test was already completed.\n\nRai went to a mobile testing site on Canton Road on January 18, as his fever became more serious. He said the way the staff carried out the test was similar to his experience at the community testing centre. Deciding that he shouldn’t be waiting any longer, he called an ambulance that same Monday afternoon and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital.\n\nHe was tested again at the hospital on Monday night, and was confirmed to have the coronavirus the next morning. In the afternoon, Rai received a text message notifying him that his test at the mobile testing site came back negative.\n\nIn a phone interview with RTHK while on 24-hour oxygen supply in hospital, Rai recounted what he called a “very unsatisfying experience”. He said he has now had pneumonia, with both lungs affected.\n\n“If I take out the oxygen, it’s quite difficult to breathe. When I go to the toilet, and when I come back or if I talk for too long, I start losing my breath. But other than that, I’m in a reasonably stable condition,” Rai said.\n\nHe said he has been given some medication to alleviate his headache, as well as some antibiotics, but doctors have yet to decide whether he will need to undergo an experimental treatment for Covid-19.\n\nRai lives with his wife, son, cousin and her husband, in a two bedroom apartment on Reclamation Street. All five of them have contracted the coronavirus, and Rai said community testing failed to detect the virus in all but one of them.\n\nRai’s son and wife took a Covid test on Monday, which came back negative the next day. They were found to have been infected after another test while under quarantine in Penny’s Bay from Monday night.\n\n“If it had only happened to me, maybe I’m the exception. But it happened to my son, it happened to my wife, it happened to my brother-in-law who also tested negative first then positive later. In my family of five people, it happened five times. That is nowhere near an acceptable and reasonable number.”\n\n“I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg. The government, I think, has to improve its inspection of what the contractors are doing down in the field.”\n\nRai said the government should set up a mechanism to monitor frontline staff collecting samples at the testing sites, making sure they are doing their jobs properly.\n\n“Based on my personal experience, this is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money,” he said, “I hope nobody else, no other Hong Kong person goes through what I went through.”",

    "content": "A banned Thai opposition politician, who is facing a criminal complaint of defaming the monarchy, defended on Thursday his criticism of the government's coronavirus vaccine strategy that relies on a company owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\nThanathorn Juangroongruangkit this week accused the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of mishandling the vaccine campaign, saying it was too reliant on Siam Bioscience and will be slow to protect the public.\n\nThe Thai company is owned by the Crown Property Bureau, the organisation that manages tens of billions of dollars in investment under the king's personal control.\n\nSiam Bioscience agreed in October to manufacture AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and supply it domestically and across Southeast Asia.\n\nThe government has ordered 61 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine for its population, as well as two million doses of a vaccine made by China's Sinovac Biotech.\n\nThanathorn had alleged the AstraZeneca deal lacked transparency and Siam Bioscience was given an unfair advantage over other companies.\n\nHe said the government, by relying mostly on AstraZeneca instead of negotiating multiple deals, has slowed the rollout of vaccines for Thais to June, while other countries have already begun to vaccinate their populations.\n\nBoth AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience declined to comment on Thanathorn's allegations.\n\nThe government has defended its policy and on Wednesday filed a criminal complaint against Thanathorn for his criticism, accusing him of royal insult under article 112 of the criminal code that is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"The deals were not negotiated independently of each other. There was no selection process or comparison so questions must be raised,\" Thanathorn told a news conference, during which he said the prime minister was using article 112 to silence him.\n\nA government spokeswoman, Ratchada Dhanadirek, has denied the prosecution was politically motivated.\n\nThanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years after a court dissolved his Future Forward Party last year for illegal loans.\n\nThe party won significant support among younger voters in a 2019 general election, coming third, with a campaign that focussed on opposition to military influence over politics.\n\nThe government said the election was free and fair but opposition parties say it was designed to ensure former junta leader Prayuth remained in power.

Rescuers have not been able to contact 10 others.\n\nThe local government said on its official social media feed on Thursday that rescuers had started drilling a 10th channel with a 711-mm diameter that they hope will allow the 11 to be extracted.\n\nThe road to the mine, cutting through muddy apple orchards and warehouses, had been sealed off by police to ensure rescue efforts were not hampered. Health workers in white protective gear took temperatures beside mounded earth and tents as part of Covid-19 precautions.\n\nAbout 600 people are involved in the rescue, with as many as 25 ambulances waiting at the scene, as well as neurosurgeons, trauma specialists and psychologists.\n\nChina's mines are among the world's deadliest. In December, 23 people died after being trapped in a coal mine in the southwestern city of Chongqing, with one survivor rescued after more than 30 hours of efforts.

    "content": "Experts advising the government on its Covid vaccination programme are recommending a phased approach, with residents and staff at care homes to get inoculated first, followed by healthcare workers and the elderly, before the programme is expanded to younger people with chronic medical problems.\n\nWhile Hong Kong has secured more than 22.5 million doses of three different vaccines, most won’t arrive for months.\n\nThe first vaccines from Sinovac are due to arrive by the end of January, but the mainland firm hasn't provided enough data to the authorities and the product hasn’t been cleared for use, resulting in uncertainty over when the free universal vaccination programme will begin.\n\nHowever, experts from two scientific committees under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), along with a separate panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, concluded that there will not be enough vaccines to protect the entire community in the intial stage of the inoculation programme.\n\nAs such, they think the best approach is to protect the most vulnerable first.\n\nIn a report published on Thursday, the experts said residents of elderly homes are the most at risk of suffering severe illness or even death from Covid-19. Homes for the disabled, and other institutional settings such as prisons, are also considered to be at the highest risk of infection, so residents and staff of these facilities will get first priority for the jabs.\n\nAnd because the risk of death from Covid-19 rises exponentially with age, anyone aged 60 or above will get the jabs second, alongside healthcare workers, and people who provide services deemed essential to the community.\n\nThird on the priority list are chronically ill people between 16 and 59 years old.\n\nThe experts also stressed that there’s a need to maintain social distancing measures, and for the public to keep wearing masks and maintain good hand hygiene to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nThey say the recommendations may be updated once more data from vaccine trials are available.\n\nSpeaking in Legco, health secretary Sophia Chan said the government will work to start the universal vaccination programme as soon as possible, and authorities believe it can be launched after the lunar new year holidays.",

    "date": "2021-01-22 HKT 08:13",
    "content": "A new form of African swine fever identified in Chinese pig farms is most likely caused by illicit vaccines, industry insiders say, a fresh blow to the world's largest pork producer, still recovering from a devastating epidemic of the virus.\n\nTwo new strains of African swine fever have infected more than 1,000 sows on several farms owned by New Hope Liuhe, China's fourth-largest producer, as well as pigs being fattened for the firm by contract farmers, said Yan Zhichun, the company's chief science officer.\n\nThough the strains, which are missing one or two key genes present in the wild African swine fever virus, don't kill pigs like the disease that ravaged China's farms in 2018 and 2019, they cause a chronic condition that reduces the number of healthy piglets born, Yan told Reuters. At New Hope, and many large producers, infected pigs are culled to prevent the spread, making the disease effectively fatal.\n\nAlthough the known infections are limited now, if the strains spread widely, they could slash pork output in the world's top consumer and producer; two years ago, swine fever wiped out half of China's 400 million-head pig herd. Pork prices are still at record levels and China is under pressure to strengthen food security amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I don't know where they come from, but we find some mild field infections caused by some sort of gene-deleted viruses,\" Yan said.\n\nWayne Johnson, a Beijing-based veterinarian, said he diagnosed a chronic, or less-lethal, form of the disease in pigs last year. The virus lacked certain genetic components, known as the MGF360 genes. New Hope has found strains of the virus missing both the MGF360 genes and the CD2v genes, Yan said.\n\nResearch has shown that deleting some MGF360 genes from African swine fever creates immunity. But the modified virus was not developed into a vaccine because it tended to later mutate back to a harmful state.\n\n\"You can sequence these things, these double deletions, and if it's exactly the same as described in the lab, it's too much of a coincidence, because you would never get that exact deletion,\" said Lucilla Steinaa, principal scientist at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi.\n\nThere is no approved vaccine for African swine fever, which is not harmful to humans. But many Chinese farmers struggling to protect their pigs have resorted to unapproved products, industry insiders and experts said. They fear illicit vaccines have created accidental infections, which are now spreading.\n\nThe new strains could proliferate globally through contaminated meat, infecting pigs that are fed on kitchen waste. The virus is known to survive for months in some pork products.\n\nChina's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to two requests for comment.\n\nBut it has issued at least three warnings against use of unauthorised African swine fever vaccines, cautioning that they could have severe side effects and that producers and users could be charged with a criminal offence.\n\nIn August, the ministry said it would test pigs for different strains of the virus as part of a nationwide investigation into illegal vaccine use.\n\nAny strains with gene deletions could indicate a vaccine had been used, it said. No findings have been published so far on the issue, which is highly sensitive for Beijing. Reporting of the recent African swine fever outbreaks was extensively covered up.\n\nAfter decades of research toward producing a vaccine against the huge, complex swine fever virus, researchers around the world are focussing on live-virus vaccines - the only type to have shown any promise.\n\nBut such vaccines carry higher risks because even after the virus is weakened so it does not cause serious illness, it can sometimes recover its virulence.\n\nOne such vaccine used in Spain in the 1960s caused a chronic disease with swollen joints, skin lesions and respiratory issues in pigs that complicated efforts to eradicate African swine fever over the next three decades. Since then, no nation has approved a vaccine for the disease.\n\nA vaccine with both MGF360 and CD2v genes deleted is undergoing trials by China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute after showing promise.\n\nYan said he believes that people have replicated the sequences of virus strains being studied, which have been published in scientific literature, and that pigs injected with illicit vaccines based on them could be infecting others.\n\n\"It's definitely man-made; this is not a natural strain,\" he said.\n\nNeither Johnson nor Yan have fully sequenced the new swine fever strains. Beijing strictly controls who is allowed to work with the virus, which can only be handled in laboratories with high biosecurity designations.\n\nBut several private companies have developed test kits that can check for specific genes.\n\nGM Biotech, based in China's central Hunan province, said in an online post last week it had developed a test that identifies whether the pathogen is a virulent strain, a single-gene deleted attenuated strain, or a double-gene deleted attenuated strain.\n\nThe test helps pig producers because the new strains are \"very difficult to detect at the initial stage of infection and have a longer incubation period after infection,\" the company said.\n\nThe government has not said how widely used illicit vaccines are or who has produced them. But a \"vast amount\" of pigs in China have nonetheless been vaccinated, Johnson said, a sentiment echoed by many other experts.\n\nIn 2004-5, when the H5 bird flu strains were spreading across Asia, Chinese laboratories produced several unauthorised live bird flu vaccines, said Mo Salman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Colorado State University, who has worked on animal health in Asia, raising fears that they could produce dangerous new variants.\n\n\"The current ASF unlawful vaccine(s) in China is repeating history,\" Salman said.

They remain tariff-free.\n\nBut more powerful versions use an imported system, which will now be bought in Britain, creating jobs.\n\n\"It will take a few months,\" Gupta told Reuters.\n\n\"Brexit, which we thought is a risk ... has become an opportunity for Nissan,\" he added.\n\nAsked about trade disruption, Gupta told reporters: \"When I look at how Nissan has come out from the crisis of (a) tsunami, earthquake, flood, last week snow, tornadoes..., the startup problem which we are seeing in the ports is peanuts.\"\n\n\"For a global manufacturer... to have additional documentation to fill a form at the border is nothing. People prepared for it, we have updated our software, we have updated our processes. It's OK.\"\n\nThe effect of Brexit will vary between automakers.\n\nNissan opened what is now Britain's biggest car plant in 1986 and made nearly 350,000 vehicles there in 2019.\n\nIn contrast, Ford, which imports everything it sells in Britain, has raised some UK prices due to US-sourced content.\n\nWithout UK electric car output, Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has criticised a UK ban on the sale of new conventional cars from 2030, as it decides the future of its factory.\n\nBut Gupta said the move would boost Nissan's British-made models.\n\n\"The market will pull more and more electrified cars, which means the return on investment on these kind of technologies will be better and better day by day.\" (Reuters)",

The flame will be lit on July 23, 2021.\"\n\nJapan has been hit less severely by the pandemic than many other advanced economies, but a recent surge in cases has forced it to close its borders to non-resident foreigners and declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and major cities.\n\nAbout 80 percent of people in Japan do not want the Games to be held this summer, recent opinion polls show, over fears the influx of athletes will spread the virus further.\n\nThe Olympic Games represents a major milestone for Japan and its premier, Yoshihide Suga, who has said the event would bring \"hope and courage\" to the world. Suga reiterated on Friday that it would go ahead as planned. (Reuters)",

So even if one or two [infected residents there] were not detected, the risk of spreading to the whole of Hong Kong is low,\" he said.\n\n\"But if you are able to contain the virus at other areas in Yau Tsim Mong district, it'd be more effective in the overall infection control.

They might also criticise the policy address, but we don't do it in a very obstructive manner.”\n\nHe said he believes the government will listen to the advice and criticism aired during the debate.\n\nResults from a public opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute right after the policy address announcement in November showed 64 percent of those interviewed disapproved of the policy blueprint, with people surveyed giving it an average 27.2 marks out of a hundred.\n\nBut Chow said pro-government legislators had reflected social needs to officials attending the debate, and had raised concerns ranging from anti-epidemic efforts to support for the unemployed.",

That’s probably the reason why more people chose the inactivated virus technology,\" Lam said at a press conference.\n\n\"I wouldn’t really put too much emphasis on the branding of the vaccines, but rather the technology behind them.\"\n\nLam also said he has no problem with the government’s plan to prioritise care home residents and staff over healthcare workers when the inoculation programme is launched.\n\nHe said while he believes doctors and nurses should be among the first groups of people to get the jabs, they don't need to be right at the front of the queue because they are well-trained and can protect themselves using their professional knowledge.",

The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor on Friday.\n\nThat came the morning after McConnell asked the House to delay sending the charges until next Thursday, and to agree not to start the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defence against the charge that he incited insurrection by his followers who stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\n\"This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House,\" McConnell said on Friday. \"The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself.\"\n\nThe moves come as Schumer and McConnell are struggling to assert control in a 50-50 chamber where Democrats hold now hold a razor-thin majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.\n\nThe trial could distract from Democratic President Joe Biden's efforts to push an ambitious legislative agenda through Congress, including nearly US$2 trillion in fresh Covid-19 relief for Americans and US businesses, as well as the need to confirm his Cabinet nominees.\n\nTrump last week became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, and when the Senate convenes for his trial will be the first president to be tried after leaving office, for his alleged role in urging his supporters to storm the Capitol in an attack that left five dead.\n\nTen House Republicans joined Democrats on January 13 in impeaching him. The support of at least 17 Senate Republicans would be needed to convict him; a separate vote would then be needed to ban him from running for office again.\n\nSuch a vote could signal that senior Republicans were eager to remove Trump as the de facto leader of their party; he has said he may seek to run again in 2024.\n\nTrump's fate ultimately could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republican lawmakers. The Kentucky Republican said this week that the mob was \"fed lies\" and \"provoked by the president and other powerful people.\" (Reuters)",

Nobody is allowed to leave until everyone in the area has taken a test and the results have been confirmed.\n\nThe government's goal is to complete the action in about 48 hours.\n\nThe authorities stated that temporary sampling stations will be set up in the \"restricted areas\" and people will be required to get tested before midnight on Saturday.\n\nPeople will be organised into groups to undergo nucleic acid testing at sampling stations, where throat and nasal cavity swabs will be used for sampling.\n\nThe government will arrange for people with mobility impairments and the elderly, including residents of elderly homes in the district, to undergo testing at home, or arrange for them to collect and submit deep throat saliva samples by themselves.\n\nThe authorities said that they understand that this arrangement will cause inconvenience to the public, and have arranged sufficient testing resources to conduct testing for everybody in the \"restricted area\" as soon as possible.\n\nThe aim is to complete the operation within about 48 hours, so that the public can start to return to work at around 6 am on Monday. When the relevant announcement is officially revoked, the government will make a separate announcement.\n\nIf an employee is unable to go to work due to the announcement, the government hopes that the employer can deal with it at their discretion and not deduct the employee’s salary and benefits.\n\nThe government has also prepared simple food and cleaning supplies for residents. The Home Affairs Department has set up hotlines 2399 6949 and 2835 1473, and also set up hotlines 3755 6816 specifically for ethnic minorities.\n\nIn addition, the government has also issued mandatory inspection notices for all premises in the \"restricted area\". Anyone who has been in the \"restricted area\" for more than two hours in the past 14 days, even if not in the \"restricted area\" when the relevant declaration takes effect, they must also undergo compulsory testing before midnight on Saturday.",

But the government is obliged to provide all the needed assistance. In this case, for example, we know that the residents being affected are not allowed to leave their homes for up to 48 hours. So what the government has done is we provide them with food packs, which we believe should be able to support them for the next two days”, she said.\n\nLam also stressed that the restrictions were nothing like the lockdowns seen on the mainland or abroad, saying the impact was minimal.\n\n“A lockdown normally means you are not allowed to go out for a period. But in our case, this prohibition is linked to the test… so once the compulsory testing is being completed, then the order will be lifted and people will be allowed to go out,” she said.\n\nWhen asked to assess her own performance in combating Covid-19 over the past year, Lam said her government had done \"all it could\" to battle the virus.\n\n\"There is no best, only better,\" she said.",

    "date": "2021-01-23 HKT 17:31",
    "content": "The leaders of the US Senate agreed on Friday to push back former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial by two weeks, giving the chamber more time to focus on President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and Cabinet nominees before turning to the contentious showdown over Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the trial is set to begin during the week of Monday February 8, an arrangement praised by the chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe House of Representatives is due to formally deliver to the Senate on Monday the impeachment charge accusing Trump of inciting an insurrection, a move that ordinarily would have triggered the beginning of the trial within a day. The charge stems from Trump's incendiary speech to supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a rampage that delayed the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory and left five people dead, including a police officer.\n\nSchumer said the new timeline will allow the Senate to move quickly on key Biden appointees and other tasks while giving House lawmakers who will prosecute the case and Trump's team more time to prepare for the trial.\n\n\"During that period, the Senate will continue to do other business for the American people, such as Cabinet nominations and the Covid relief bill which would provide relief for millions of Americans who are suffering during this pandemic,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nThe timeline was a compromise after McConnell had asked the Democratic-led House to delay sending the charge until next Thursday, and called on Schumer to postpone the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defence.\n\nDoug Andres, a spokesman for McConnell, said the senator was pleased Democrats had given Trump's defence more time, and laid out a timeline that could have the trial begin as soon as February 9.\n\n\"This is a win for due process and fairness,\" Andres said.\n\nUnder the timeline, House impeachment managers will file their pre-trial brief and Trump's defence team will file an answer to the impeachment charge on February 2, and each side will respond to those filings on February 8.\n\nTrump on January 13 became the first U.S. president to have been impeached twice. The Senate acquitted him last year in the previous trial focused on Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son. Trump's presidential term ended on Wednesday.\n\nConviction in the Senate would require a two-thirds vote - meaning 17 of Trump's fellow Republicans would have to vote against him. A conviction would clear the way for a second vote, requiring a simply majority, to bar Trump from holding office again.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday found a slim majority of Americans believe Trump should be convicted and barred from holding public office. The responses were almost entirely along party lines, with nine out of 10 Democrats wanting Trump convicted and less than two in 10 Republicans agreeing.\n\nTrump has said he may seek the presidency again in 2024. His fate could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republicans. McConnell said this week that the mob that attacked the Capitol was \"fed lies\" and \"provoked by the president and other powerful people.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters earlier in the day that the Senate should be able to move forward with both the trial and Biden's agenda, beginning with his call for US$1.9 trillion of fresh COVID-19 assistance for Americans and the US economy.\n\n\"What cannot be delayed through this process is his proposal to get relief to the American people at this time of crisis,\" Psaki said.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, said the agreement between Schumer and McConnell was \"fair to all concerned.\"\n\n\"It allows the president's defence team adequate time to prepare and for the sake of the country, it moves the process forward,\" Graham said.\n\nSenate rules had called for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 p.m. on the day after the single article of impeachment was delivered to Senate, except for Sundays.\n\nThe deal came even as Schumer and McConnell struggled to assert control in a chamber divided 50-50, with Democrats holding a majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.\n\nMcConnell has insisted that Democrats provide a guarantee that they will not end what is known as the legislative filibuster, which enables the minority Republicans to put up procedural hurdles for legislation sought by Biden.\n\nSchumer rejected McConnell's demand on Friday as \"unacceptable.\" Schumer became the chamber's leader this week after Democrats won two Georgia U.S. Senate runoff elections earlier in the month.

All but three of the newly-confirmed patients were infected locally, and nearly half of these had no known infection source.\n\nThe centre's Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan said she still expected the number of cases to increase over the next few days, after the government ordered everyone in a restricted zone in Jordan to get tested.\n\n“We are expecting the daily number of cases to get more and more in the coming few days because of the enhanced testing in the restricted area, and also there’s still quite significant transmission in the community,” Chuang said.\n\nShe called on members of the public to pay attention to their health even after testing negative for Covid-19, saying they should seek medical help if they develop mild symptoms.\n\nWhen asked about the SAR’s year-long fight against the coronavirus, Chuang said it had been a difficult year for everybody.\n\n“The one-year battle has not been easy, not just for Hong Kong, but the whole world too. We adopted a lot of unprecedented measures, everyone experienced unprecedented situations. No one would ever have expected flights to be halted and borders to be closed. We are all learning from experience,” Chuang said.\n\nShe also praised Hong Kong people for their efforts in fighting the virus.\n\n“We wear masks and we’ve been adopting various anti-epidemic measures.

    "content": "Southampton dumped FA Cup holders Arsenal out of the competition on Saturday, winning 1-0 courtesy of a Gabriel own goal to set up a fifth-round meeting with Wolves.\n\nThe much-changed Gunners, who have won the competition a record 14 times, fell behind midway through the first half and could not find a way back.\n\nRalph Hasenhuttl fielded a strong side at St Mary's, with Danny Ings returning after a hamstring injury and a positive coronavirus test alongside former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott.\n\nMikel Arteta made seven changes from their 3-0 Premier League win against Newcastle on Monday.\n\nSouthampton, who had never previously beaten Arsenal in the FA Cup, were the brighter team in the first half in the winter sunshine on England's south coast.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse rattled the crossbar from a swerving corner and Che Adams forced a fine save from Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nSouthampton got the reward their positive approach deserved in the 24th minute.\n\nMohamed Elneny gave away possession on the edge of his own box and the ball was worked to Kyle Walker-Peters on the right side of the Southampton attack.\n\nThe defender drilled it across the six-yard area and it was inadvertently turned in by Gabriel - the first time rejuvenated Arsenal had conceded since December 26 against Chelsea.\n\nWard-Prowse then struck a shot from distance that sailed wide and Ings hit a fierce volley that was blocked by Hector Bellerin.\n\nArsenal found their feet in the second half and Fraser Forster was forced to make a sharp save with his feet to keep out Eddie Nketiah's deflected shot after a pass from Nicolas Pepe.\n\nArteta threw on forward Alexandre Lacazette to bolster his attack as Arsenal pinned Southampton back.\n\nLacazette was inches away from getting on the end of a teasing cross by fellow substitute Bukayo Saka as the minutes ticked away but Arsenal could not find an equaliser.\n\nThe exit will be a bitter disappointment for Arsenal, who have won the FA Cup four times in the past seven seasons - in sharp contrast to their toils in the Premier League.\n\nArteta's side will return to Southampton for a league meeting on Tuesday, aiming to continue their fine recent run that has lifted them to 10th in the table.

    "content": "The Chinese city of Wuhan marked one year since the start of its traumatic 76-day coronavirus lockdown on Saturday, while the pandemic raged elsewhere and governments scrambled to put in place new measures.\n\nEurope faced a worsening struggle with production woes hitting supply of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.\n\nAround the world, more than 2.1 million people have died of Covid-19 since it emerged in China in December 2019, with over 98 million infected.\n\nIn the world's worst-hit country, US President Joe Biden warned America's death toll could pass 600,000, the highest estimate yet that would mark a devastating rise on the 400,000 fatalities so far.\n\nBut the picture was vastly different in Wuhan, where humming traffic, bustling sidewalks, and citizens packing parks and public transport underscored the scale of the recovery in the metropolis of 11 million where the pathogen first emerged before going global.\n\n\"I think Wuhan is quite safe now, safer than my hometown and most places in China,\" 21-year-old resident Wang Yizhe said.\n\nElsewhere in China, new outbreaks have prompted harsh responses.\n\nAstraZeneca said late on Friday that \"lower yield\" at one of its vaccine-making sites would affect deliveries across Europe.\n\nLithuania estimated it would receive 80 percent fewer AstraZeneca doses than hoped in the first quarter, although German and French ministers tried to reassure the public of a steady supply.\n\nDeliveries of Pfizer-made shots to the continent's countries are already behind schedule as the US firm upgrades capacity at a Belgian plant.\n\nAt a meeting with AstraZeneca representatives, the EU Commission \"insisted on a precise delivery schedule on the basis of which member states should be planning their vaccination programmes\", Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted.\n\nAlready cleared for use in Britain, EU authorities are expected to give the vaccine the green light at the end of January.\n\nOn Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was \"some evidence\" the new strain first detected in the country \"may be associated with a higher degree of mortality\" as well as being more infectious.\n\nAt 95,981 as of Friday, the UK death toll is the highest in Europe.\n\nThe World Health Organisation reassured that fabric masks should still work in hindering the spread of new variants from Britain, South Africa and Brazil.\n\nHowever, Norwegian capital Oslo toughened health restrictions after the British variant was found in a retirement home, closing all but essential shops and asking people to restrict movements.\n\nA French government source said a new lockdown in the country looked increasingly likely with the more transmissible strain.\n\nMeanwhile the Netherlands introduced its first curfew since World War II, from 9 pm until 4:30 am.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, newly-installed President Biden stepped up federal aid even as he gave his highest estimate yet of the eventual toll.\n\n\"The virus is surging,\" he said. \"We're at 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000.\"\n\nAnd in the Colombian capital of Bogota, residents were under their third weekend quarantine in a row, meaning the closure of all non-essential shops in the city of eight million from Friday at 8 pm until Monday at 4 am.\n\nIn Mexico, where hospitals have been overwhelmed and over 146,000 have died, people are queueing for hours to buy oxygen to care for the growing numbers fighting coronavirus at home.\n\nBrazilian scientists have meanwhile warned that the country faces running out of vaccine doses and basic equipment like syringes, just as its vaccination campaign gets underway - with some blaming government for the shortages.\n\nIn Wuhan, a team of World Health Organisation experts was still in hotel quarantine ahead of a mission to investigate the source of the virus.\n\n\"All hypotheses are on the table,\" WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference in Geneva.\n\n\"And it is definitely too early to come to a conclusion of exactly where this virus started, either within or without China.\"\n\nBut there was good news on Friday for poorer nations, as the WHO and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer announced a deal for up to 40 million initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be made available to them through the Covax global pool.\n\nA separate deal, brokered by international agencies working with the WHO, will supply developing nations with tens of millions of rapid antigen tests at half the usual US$5 price.

    "content": "The US Senate Finance Committee on Friday unanimously approved Janet Yellen's nomination as the first woman Treasury secretary, indicating that she will easily win full Senate approval, but Republicans called for her to work with them in developing economic policies.\n\nThe full Senate will vote on Yellen's nomination on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor late on Friday, which would allow her to get to work promptly on President Joe Biden's economic agenda.\n\nHer nomination was approved 26-0 in the evenly split committee, with concerns expressed by Republicans about Biden's ambitious plans for massive coronavirus relief spending, infrastructure investment and tax hikes failing to sway them against the former Federal Reserve chair.\n\n\"I have very strong disagreements with Dr Yellen on a number of her positions, particularly in the tax policy arena, but she has committed to us that she will work with us,\" Republican Senator Mike Crapo said after the vote.\n\n\"And I think the strong vote on our side to support her today is an indication that we want to engage.\"\n\nBiden has proposed a US$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan and has pledged to invest US$2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.\n\nAt Yellen's confirmation hearing before the committee on Tuesday, Republicans expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits with the 2017 tax cuts and nearly US$5 trillion in coronavirus spending last year under former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I can tell you, a lot of times I don't think you could get a 26-to-nothing vote to agree to buy a soda,\" said Democrat Ron Wyden, who will soon become Senate Finance Committee chairman. \"So, this is an indication that she is really an NBA All-Star when it comes to Senate confirmation.\"\n\nA full confirmation vote just days after Biden took office would put the 74-year-old PhD economist and daughter of a Brooklyn, New York, family doctor quickly to work on a deep economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. She broke a similar gender barrier when she became Fed chair in 2014, a role she held until 2018.\n\nYellen's Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump's 2017 inauguration on a party-line vote.

    "content": "A government adviser on the pandemic has said the area around the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market may be next to face a lockdown, as he urged officials to move faster to avoid leaks if they have to seal off an area of town again.\n\nDavid Hui, a respiratory disease expert at the Chinese University, said on Sunday that the number of cases around the fruit market was on the rise, and officials may have to seal if off for testing. The market is close to an area of Jordan which was sealed off on Saturday.\n\nHui told a TV programme that he was concerned that some people had left the Jordan area before it was sealed and may now be spreading the coronavirus elsewhere.\n\nHe said it was possible that people were tipped off when officials advised hawkers to move their equipment from the area's streets. He said that, in future, less notice should be given.\n\nReports that the lockdown was imminent were widespread from Friday morning, and a number of people were filmed leaving the area with bags of possessions.\n\nHui said the mass testing operation had been efficient, with about 7,000 people already tested, but added that another round of testing might be needed if the authorities find a high number of positive cases.\n\nHe also noted the number of cases around the nearby Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market was on the rise and said the authorities might need to seal that district for testing.\n\nAsked about calls from pro-Beijing figures for universal testing in the SAR, Hui said it was better in Hong Kong's case to place a small neighbourhood in lockdown, as imposing a wider lockdown was very difficult.\n\nHe said the government would have to tackle logistical and manpower problems.\n\nOfficials have banned anyone from entering or leaving the affected area of Jordan until everyone is tested and results are returned. They say they hope to be able to reopen it from 6am on Monday.",

    "content": "A Yau Tsim Mong district councillor on Sunday accused the government of failing to show cultural sensitivity in its treatment of people locked down in Jordan, after Muslim residents were handed food packages containing luncheon meat.\n\nOfficials handed out food parcels on Saturday after imposing a lockdown and ordering testing for everyone in an area of more than 10,000 residents that has seen a surge in coronavirus cases. They included tinned luncheon meat as well as other food such as bread and instant noodles.\n\nCouncillor Leslie Chan said officials hadn't thought through the contents of the parcels for an area where a high proportion of residents are from ethnic minorities.\n\n\"We also see that the government provided foods to the residents, but the problem is it included luncheon meat, which is pork,\" he said. \"The Muslim residents can't eat pork because of religious reasons.\"\n\nChan is also helping a store owner who’s worried about feeding her two cats in her stall.\n\n\"The government just think about the [residents] but doesn't have animal rights in mind,\" he said. \"[Officials] should have more cultural and animal sensitivity.\"\n\nAsked about the content of the food parcels during a visit to the area this morning, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said: \"Because we are not only distributing [the foods] to the ethnic minorities, the foods are not targeted [to one group of people].\n\n\"The food package includes fish, bread as well as noodles. If you have noticed, they include not only luncheon meat, we have various choices of cans such as tuna and others, as well as soups and white bread and even chocolate and muesli bars. There are also fruits. So people are free to take what they want.”\n\nOther people RTHK spoke to near the locked-down area said they'd been inconvenienced, although they understood the reasons for the action.\n\nAhmad, said he felt bad about the lockdown because none of the shops in the area were operating. But asked whether the action was needed he said: \"Yes, it must be, because there are too many cases in Jordan.\"\n\nChella, who was bringing food for her father, brother and step-mother, who live in the affected area, said her family was shocked when the lockdown was introduced. She said she'd been reluctant to visit but felt she had to.",

Health Secretary Sophia Chan confirmed shortly afterwards that another case had been found.\n\n\"We have put all close contacts under quarantine,\" Chuang said. \"Also some of cases, if not all of them, are staying in subdivided flats.\n\n\"We will put all those who share subdivided flats, even those who are not in the same household, under quarantine as well so as to minimise the risk of transmission.\"\n\nIn September, authorities tested some 1.78 million samples from those who joined the the territory-wide programme and identified 32 new cases. The positive rate was about 0.002 percent.\n\nBut Chuang noted the situation was different as it was towards the end of third wave of infections in September.\n\nOfficials said Hong Kong confirmed 76 coronavirus cases on Sunday, 27 of which have no clear source of infection. There are also four imported cases, all involving domestic helpers arriving from Indonesia.\n\nAmong the local cases, 23 were from the Yau Tsim Mong district.

Sky said it will be based on first-person accounts of events.\n\nThe casting of Branagh caught attention, with The Sunday Telegraph featuring a photo of Branagh on its front page, headlined: \"Meet our new prime minister.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old has had a wide-ranging career, directing and starring in Shakespearean dramas and Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and recently playing the Russian villain in Christopher Nolan's \"Tenet.\"\n\nThe series will be directed by Michael Winterbottom, acclaimed for films such as \"A Cock and Bull Story\" and television series including \"The Trip,\" starring British comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.\n\nThe director said he would focus on \"the efforts of scientists, doctors, care home workers and policy makers to protect us from the virus.\"\n\nJohnson's term in office during the pandemic saw him dramatically rushed to hospital and placed in intensive care with the virus. His baby son was born two days after he returned to work.\n\nHis policies have been widely criticised, with Britain's numbers of cases and deaths now the highest in Europe.\n\nCritics say he was too slow to roll out measures such as rules on mask-wearing and virus tests for arriving travellers that other countries imposed much earlier.\n\nThe topical political drama is not the first to focus on Johnson's policies.\n\nIt comes after Britain's Channel 4 in 2019 aired a show called \"Brexit: The Uncivil War\" with \"Sherlock\" star Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dominic Cummings, the strategist behind the \"Vote Leave\" campaign.\n\nCummings came under strong criticism last year after he refused to apologise for taking a lengthy road trip while ill with Covid-19 during the first national lockdown.",

The area, around Shanghai Street, was sealed off early on Saturday, when health workers were brought in to test all residents for the virus.\n\nAt about 3.30 am, television footage showed police leaving the area and removing barricades. Later the Transport Department said transport arrangements in the area were returning to normal, as road sections reopened.\n\nOvernight, government cleaners had washed down the streets – with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department saying that Yau Ma Tei Market and Reclamation Street Cooked Food Hawker Bazaar were being deep cleansed and disinfected so they could open this morning.\n\nFor most, though, there'd been relief on Sunday evening, when the government let those with negative Covid-19 tests leave and re-enter. It was a welcome break from the lockdown which began early on Saturday. Many said they just wanted some decent food. One resident, surnamed Cheng, said he had been eating instant noodles for two days.\n\nEarlier, the Health Secretary, Sophia Chan, said the lockdown had been effective and that the government might enforce lockdowns in other districts.\n\n\"We will review the cases, we will look at the criteria and also the considerations - including public health considerations, the number of confirmed cases, plus the environmental factors, \" she said.\n\nThe Jordan restricted area has many old and dilapidated building, often with damaged sewage pipes. Many of the buildings have subdivided flats.\n\nOn Sunday, a government adviser on the pandemic, Chinese University Professor David Hui, said officials might have to consider a lockdown near the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market, where there has been an upsurge in cases.",

    "content": "An epidemiologist has cast doubt on the effectiveness of further lockdowns in Hong Kong, after just 13 people out of more than 7,000 tested in the Jordan area at the weekend tested positive.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Benjamin Cowling of the University of Hong Kong's school of public health, said the low number of cases was unlikely to do much to bring the virus under control.\n\nHowever Cowling, who is also co-director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at HKU, told RTHK's Mike Weeks that vaccination could bring hope of a return to relative normality as soon as September.\n\nHe said the 13 cases in Jordan were \"a minority of all the cases that have been observed\" and transmission continued in other parts of the SAR.\n\n\"I'm not sure that locking down other small parts of the city would make a lot of difference in getting on top of the case numbers right now,\" he said.\n\n\"We've seen this sort of approach being used very successfully in mainland China but it's used in a quite different way, where they'll lock down and test everybody probably two times, not just once, with the aim of getting infections to zero very, very quickly. That's not what's been done in Hong Kong.\"\n\nCowling said the mainland had better logistics and support for people under lockdown, and noted that Hong Kong had not mentioned compensation for people and businesses affected.\n\nHe said there was \"a lot of fatigue\" after a year of control measures, while the economic effects of social distancing were also showing. He said this pointed to more difficulties in the next few months before vaccination could take effect.\n\n\"I really hope that by September it will be possible at least for the government to say if we can get 70 percent plus vaccine coverage, we're going to open up the airport, stop the quarantine for travellers and aim to get back to normal as soon as possible, schools are going back to normal, and maybe just have a few social distancing measures in the back pocket in case case numbers flare up from time to time.\"\n\nOfficials hope to begin vaccination next month after the Lunar New Year Holiday. A vaccine from BioNTech, supplied by Fosun Pharma, had been approved for use, but government advisers are seeking more information on a jab from Sinovac.\n\nCowling said that if reports that the Sinovac vaccine was only 50 percent effective proved accurate it wouldn't help in providing herd immunity.",

Ho said infected people might already have spread the virus to other places before the lockdown.\n\nThe expert warned that completing one round of mass testing in the area doesn’t mean that the virus won’t return to the community. He said some of the hundreds of people who fled the area just before the lockdown may bring the virus back with them when they return to their homes.\n\nMeanwhile another medical expert, Leung Chi-chiu, said the number of cases found wasn't high and he believes the weekend lockdown wasn't the best use of resources.\n\nHe said the cases could have been detected through mandatory testing, adding that experience from other compulsory testing exercises shows that most residents would be willing to cooperate.\n\nLeung said with the city having recorded over 200 untraceable cases in the past week, the virus is already spreading in different areas.\n\nHe said the government could have used its manpower and resources to carry out testing in various places, rather than focus on the lockdown.\n\nAsked whether he thinks there’s a need to impose a lockdown around the Yau Ma Tei Fruit Market – where dozens of cases have been found – Leung said sealing off the area would greatly affect vendors and residents, and it would also be difficult to trace the large number of customers who have visited the market recently.\n\nLeung said he believes it would be better for the government to just carry out mandatory testing in the area.",

It's time we treated it like one,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nIn his last days in office, Donald Trump announced that a Covid-19 ban on travellers arriving from much of Europe and Brazil would be lifted, but the Biden administration immediately said it would reverse the order due to come into effect on January 26.\n\nTrump had announced an initial ban on January 31, 2020 on non-American travellers entering from China to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

    "content": "Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered for its first national congress since 2016 on Monday with a mission to select new leaders and shape policy for the next five years and beyond.\n\nThe event, the 13th congress since the Communist Party of Vietnam was established in 1930, brought nearly 1,600 delegates from across the country to Hanoi. On a foggy morning in the capital, they paid a ceremonial visit to the mausoleum of founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh before meetings began.\n\nVietnamese officials traditionally visit the mausoleum ahead of important meetings and national events.\n\nAmid stringent coronavirus testing to preserve Vietnam's comparative success in keeping the pandemic at bay, delegates will pick a new leadership team in nine days of meetings, mostly behind closed doors, aiming to bolster both the country's ongoing economic success and the legitimacy of the Party's rule.\n\nDelegates to the congress, foreign dignitaries, support staff and media attending the event were all tested twice for the coronavirus in the days leading up to the gathering. According to the health ministry, a total of 10,000 people have been tested in conjunction with the congress.\n\nThat approach echoes the tough quarantine measures, testing and tracing that have contributed to Vietnam having far fewer virus cases than most other countries: it has reported just over 1,500 Covid-19 infections and 35 deaths in total.\n\nIn turn, that has helped Vietnam's economy outstrip much of Asia in the past year. One of the last five Communist-ruled countries in the world besides China, Cuba, Laos and North Korea, Vietnam is already eyeing average annual gross domestic product growth of 7 percent over the next five years.\n\nBut a new leadership will be faced with the challenge of balancing relations with China and the United States, for which Vietnam has become an important strategic partner, in a world economy that's become detached from previous certainties.\n\nIn the months running up to the meeting there has been intense competition for a limited number of top posts. Vietnam officially has four 'pillars' of leadership: the Party chief; the state president; the prime minister and the National Assembly Chair.\n\nVietnam's two-term Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, 76, has been struggling with bad heath but is expected by analysts to continue for a third term. Trong wasn't seen in images/footage of the mausoleum visit released by state media, and wasn't mentioned in a report on the event by state news agency VN News, but was seen attending a meeting later.\n\nWhile a 2016 power struggle and subsequent crackdown on corruption in government has deepened factional fault lines across Party ranks, most analysts expect continuity in Vietnam's economic, domestic and foreign policy-making after the congress.\n\nThe main candidates for the new positions to be determined at the congress are all widely known in Hanoi's political circles, but were officially declared top secret in December to discourage potentially critical debate.\n\nThe Communist Party retains tight control of domestic media and tolerates little criticism.

That is why it is important for us to make sure that the Yau Ma Tei outbreak is being completely contained by more stringent measures, with compulsory testing of all the people there within the two days of cordoning,\" Yuen said.\n\nThe government has come under fire for imposing the lockdown in Yau Ma Tei and Jordan.\n\n\"If you do it early, they say it's a nuisance. if you do it later, they say you are late. It's always like this. It's a delicate and difficult balancing exercise. If there's not a considerable number of cases, what grounds do you have for such an operation? But by the time everyone thinks it must be done, people may criticise you for acting too late,\" Yuen said.\n\n\"Trying to contain a pandemic is like walking a tightrope, it's not easy to find the balance,\" he said, as he asked people to be more understanding.",

Instead, healthy elderly residents should be vaccinated when the inoculation scheme begins to mitigate the risks.\n\n“The operation of care homes will be affected if 10 or 20 percent of their residents have fever,\" he said.\n\n“In order to be on the safe side, we should consider protecting very sick or weak elderly people using other methods instead of giving them the BioNTech jabs.”\n\nLeung said officials are discussing with operators of elderly care homes, who have expressed their concern over the matter.",

She said the government does not rule out law-enforcement action against those who flout the testing order.",

No one bought food from us as there were no visitors on Temple Street. And after the lockdown, people are even more afraid to come here,\" he said.\n\n\"[Cheung] just said 'no compensation'. That's it.

That was its lowest annual growth rate in more than four decades but still made China the only major economy to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the pandemic.\n\nInternational governance should be based on rules and consensus, instead of on orders given by one or the few, Xi added, without naming any countries.\n\n\"The world is undergoing changes unseen in a century, and now is the time for major development and major transformation,\" he said.\n\nXi's speech came just five days after Joe Biden was sworn in as US president.\n\nUnder Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, tensions simmered between the United States and China, the world's top two economies, on issues ranging from trade and technology to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the coronavirus.

    "content": "Moderna said on Monday it believes its Covid-19 vaccine protects against new variants found in Britain and South Africa, although it will test a new booster shot aimed at the South Africa variant after concluding that the antibody response could be diminished.\n\nThe company said in a press release that it found no reduction in the antibody response against the variant found in Britain. Against the variant found in South Africa, it found a reduced response but still believed its two-dose regimen would provide protection.\n\nModerna shares rose nearly 10%, or $12.40, to $143.85 in morning trading.\n\nThe emergence of new variants in Britain, South Africa and Brazil has created some concern that mutations in the virus may make vaccines less effective.\n\nJefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note that it was encouraging that the Moderna testing showed that even against the variant found in South Africa, the antibody response produced by its mRNA-1273 vaccine was still \"above the levels\" that provide protection.\n\nYee also said the speed with which Moderna was able to design a new booster shot candidate was proof of the flexibility of the new mRNA technology upon which it is based.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel said he was only mildly concerned that the vaccine would not be protective against the variants.\n\n\"It is a little worrisome that you see a lesser neutralising antibody response, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you are unprotected,\" he said, noting that even these lower levels may still be enough to protect against serious infections.\n\n\"The goal of this vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital and to keep you out of the morgue. If you get a symptomatic infection or mildly symptomatic infection that is not a burden to the healthcare system,\" Offit said.\n\nModerna said the new booster shot could be made available in future if evidence were to emerge that protection declined.\n\nPfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have also said tests showed their vaccine is effective against the variant found in Britain, but have not yet disclosed results against the South Africa variant.\n\nThat variant first found in Britain has caused a massive surge in cases there and has also been found in more than a dozen U.S. states. U.S. public health officials expect it to be the dominant strain in the United States within 6 weeks.\n\nModerna said it plans to publish data from its tests against the variants on the website bioRxiv.

    "content": "Dom Sibley and Jos Buttler anchored a run chase after a jittery start as England beat Sri Lanka by six wickets Monday in the second Test to sweep the series 2-0.\n\nSibley and Buttler put on an unbeaten 75-run stand as England, who were struggling at 89-4, got to their target of 164 in an extended final session on the fourth day in Galle.\n\nThe result gave England a second successive Test whitewash in Sri Lanka after winning all three matches in the island nation in 2018.\n\n\"Really proud of how calm we were,\" skipper Joe Root said after being named man of the match and series for knocks of 228 and 186 in the first and second Test respectively. \"Credit to the bowlers for putting Sri Lanka under pressure. We are on an upward curve as a team and looking to get better.\"\n\nEngland were given a deadline to finish after spinners Jack Leach and Dom Bess skittled out Sri Lanka for 126 in their second innings.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya claimed three wickets that gave Sri Lanka hope and helped him to his Test-best match figures of 10-200.\n\nDebutant spinner Ramesh Mendis got the key wicket of skipper Joe Root, who scored 11 after his second successive ton in England's first innings total of 344, to add to the scare given to the tourists.\n\nEmbuldeniya took Zak Crawley for 13 and then ended Jonny Bairstow's stay after a quickfire 29, putting England's nerves on edge, but Sibley calmly moved to his third Test half-century.\n\nLeach and Bess took four wickets each to set up England's win.\n\nThe hosts started their second innings early in the day with a lead of 37 but it all came to an end in the afternoon session.\n\nNumber 10 Embuldeniya top-scored with 40, after taking seven wickets with his left-arm spin to end England's first innings on 344.\n\nHe was the only batsman to score more than 20 as Sri Lanka collapsed from 29 for one in their second innings.\n\nEmbuldeniya put up some resistance with a ninth-wicket stand of 48 with Suranga Lakmal, who made 11 not out, before Root took the final two wickets with his off-spin.\n\n\"He was outstanding throughout the series, doing all the hard work,\" stand-in-skipper Dinesh Chandimal said of his 24-year-old spinner. \"He always comes and asks how to improve, so I'm sure he'll be a good asset going forward.\"\n\nLeach's left-arm spin got Kusal Perera trapped lbw for 14, and off-spinner Bess sent back Oshada Fernando for three in the first session.\n\nFirst-innings centurion Angelo Mathews was then bowled by Bess for five and Chandimal fell to Leach, with James Anderson taking a superb running catch.\n\nEarlier Dilruwan Perera trapped overnight batsman Leach lbw for one on just the 11th ball of the day after England resumed on 339 for nine in Galle.\n\nLeach took a single and number 11 Anderson hit a boundary off Embuldeniya, who returned career-best figures of 7-137 in just his ninth Test, to add five runs to the overnight score.\n\nAnderson played a key part after his best bowling figures of 6-40 in Asia. The 38-year-old quick has 606 Test wickets in 157 matches.\n\nRiding on Root's double ton, England won the opening Test of the resumed series, which started last March but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEngland now head to India for a four-Test series starting February 5 in Chennai. The first two Tests will be played to empty stadiums.\n\n\"With four more Test matches on this tour it's really important we don't stand still, keep looking to improve,\" Root said. (AFP)",

    "content": "Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that she has asked Beijing to provide Hong Kong with mainland-made Covid-19 jabs, after \"hiccups\" or delays in the delivery of the vaccines the government has ordered.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of her weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam said the SAR has a \"desperate need\" for coronavirus vaccines, especially for high-risk groups and cross-border workers.\n\n“We have 10,000 truck drivers crossing the border every day, and they have to take tests every day. Now that we have a vaccine, there was a proposal put to us that they should be vaccinated as early as possible – together with the mainland truck drivers – so that there could be greater assurance and safety,\" Lam said.\n\n\"So with those considerations in mind, I sort of triggered what I’ve been given to understand in Beijing last November that if there is a need in Hong Kong, then the chief executive could always approach the central people’s government for help in trying to secure a certain proportion of mainland-developed, or mainland-produced vaccines to come to Hong Kong, and that’s exactly what I have done.”\n\nAsked how Beijing responded to her request, Lam said only that the central government has been “very supportive” in helping Hong Kong authorities tackle the pandemic, for example providing face masks, and helping with the community testing programme last September.\n\n\"I hope and I would continue to appeal to the central government to give us support on the issue of vaccine supply,\" she said\n\nOn Monday, the SAR government said it had accepted a recommendation from its expert panel on vaccines to approve a jab made by Germany's BioNTech and distributed by the mainland's Fosun Pharma.\n\nIt is the first vaccine approved for use in the SAR and a million doses are expected to arrive in the second half of next month.\n\nThe two other vaccines the government has procured but is yet to receive are the one made by Anglo-Swedish company AstraZeneca, and another from mainland firm Sinovac.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the jabs Lam would like to see Beijing send to the SAR are the Sinovac ones already ordered, or those made by another mainland company, Sinopharm.\n\nSinopharm has said its vaccine is more than 70 percent effective, but it hasn't published any data in medical journals.\n\nResearchers in Brazil recently said that they found the Sinovac jabs to be around 50 percent effective – far lower than the reported efficacy rates for the BioNTech and AstraZeneca jabs.",

They will likely be restricted to one street or several adjacent buildings, she said.\n\n\"The next thing we need to consider for the next operation is whether we could be more focused,\" said Lam.\n\n\"But we could do more at the same time. It could be one in this district, and another in another district.\"\n\nLam added that the government will improve its support and supplies for residents so they will not be \"nervous\" and will not leave the lockdown areas.\n\nShe also called on people to cooperate with testing orders, noting that more than 200 Jordan residents didn't comply with the requirement and could face penalties.\n\n\"We will go back to that building without notice and try to check everyone coming out of the building whether [they] have an SMS showing a negative result. If no, that means you have not complied,\" she said.\n\n\"Then we will take down your personal data and then pass it to the Centre for Health Protection to consider issuing a summons or, where permissible, issuing a fixed penalty ticket.\"\n\nLam said the authorities will be more \"aggressive\" with Covid-19 testing, adding that they have identified a few more places to impose mandatory testing orders.",

He explained this was why people would be required to stay for a while at the place where they have been vaccinated, so they can be monitored.\n\n\"Other serious side effects might happen in the four weeks after the vaccination, most of them within one week,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that people would be asked to record any mild side effects they have after getting the jabs, such as fever and pain at the shot sites, and the expert panel would analyse this data.\n\nHung said the experts will also look at side effects that may happen after a longer period.\n\n\"It's a new vaccine,” he said. “We don't know whether there will be side effects in the long term.

    "content": "Britain and the European Union should both get the vaccines they have ordered and it is wrong to respond to supply problems with restrictions, Nadhim Zahawi, the British Covid-19 vaccine deployment minister, said on Tuesday.\n\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn earlier backed EU proposals to restrict vaccines leaving the bloc, saying Europe should have its \"fair share\".\n\nZahawi said that he was confident the manufacturers of the three Covid-19 vaccines approved for British use, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna, would be able to meet their supply obligations, for both Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU proposal comes in the wake of AstraZeneca's decision to cut its supply to the EU by 60% to 31 million doses for the first quarter of the year, while Pfizer has also altered delivery schedules.\n\n\"I'm very confident that Pfizer... will deliver for the EU and will deliver for the UK, as will AstraZeneca,\" Zahawi told Times Radio. \"Vaccine nationalism is the wrong way to go. No one is safe until we're all safe.\"\n\nAstraZeneca has a domestic British supply chain to make its vaccine, but Britain's supplies of the Pfizer vaccine come from a factory in Belgium.\n\nThe total projected amount of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine supplied to Britain between January and March is unchanged by a planned upgrade at a production facility.\n\nBut Britain has consistently said that supply is limiting the pace of its vaccine rollout, although it expects early wrinkles to be ironed out over time.\n\n\"Supplies are tight... they continue to be,\" Zahawi told BBC TV. \"Any new manufacturing process is going to have challenges, it's lumpy and bumpy, (then) it gets better, it stabilises and improves going forward.\"\n\nBritain is seeking to give initial shots to 15 million of the most at-risk people by mid-February.

That’s the reason why we added those new designated areas in the regions that I have mentioned… because of factors that we have considered before, like the buildings are rather old with not so satisfactory management, or the number of buildings affected, and the locations of those buildings are rather concentrated. So we would like to act early and impose a more stringent testing protocol,” he said.\n\nHealth authorities on Tuesday reported 64 new coronavirus infections, all but one of them locally acquired. One-third of the infections were untraceable.\n\nMore than 50 other people tested preliminary positive for the virus.\n\nChui said the city’s coronavirus situation is still serious.\n\nHe noted that almost 500 infections were recorded in the past week, 40 percent of which were untraceable.\n\nHe announced that social distancing rules that were due to expire on Thursday will be extended for a week until February 3.",

    "content": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has reimposed a ban on children aged 10 to 14 leaving home, telling them to watch TV instead, as the country battles an outbreak of a new coronavirus strain.\n\nStay-at-home orders for all children and the elderly have been kept in place across most of the country since the start of the pandemic – even as the economy reopened after crippling lockdowns and restrictions.\n\n\"Go back to your homes... and besides they're good just with the TV. They can glue their attention to the TV the whole day,\" said Duterte.\n\nWhile many parents have flouted the rules, allowing their children to play in parks or on the street, the measure has prevented families visiting shopping malls, which are the centres of community life and consumer spending. Classrooms also have remained closed.\n\nThe prolonged restriction on movement has been blamed for hampering the country's recovery from its first recession in three decades.\n\nLast Friday, the government's coronavirus task force announced children aged 10 to 14 would be allowed outside again from February.\n\nBut Duterte overturned the decision late on Monday, saying he did not want to risk youngsters catching the more contagious British strain of the virus that has so far infected 17 people in the country, including three children.\n\n\"I'm just afraid because this new strain strikes young children,\" he said.\n\nJust hours before Duterte spoke, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said that allowing children outside again would help spur consumer demand and revive businesses battered by anti-virus measures.\n\nActing Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said this month that 50 percent of the economy was driven by \"family activities\", and without them the economy could not recover.\n\nThe Philippines' caseload of more than half a million infections is one of the highest in Southeast Asia.\n\nDuterte's administration has been criticised for its slowness to procure Covid-19 vaccines, with the bulk not expected to start arriving until the second half of the year.\n\nThe government expects data to be released on Thursday to show gross domestic product contracted by as much as 9.5 percent last year.

    "content": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte handed in his resignation to the head of state on Tuesday, hoping he would be given an opportunity to put together a new coalition and rebuild his parliamentary majority.\n\nThe deepening political crisis is playing out against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 85,000 Italians, the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth highest in the world.\n\nConte lost his absolute majority in the upper house Senate last week when a junior partner, the Italia Viva party headed by former premier Matteo Renzi, quit in a row over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and economic recession.\n\nEfforts to lure centrist and independent senators into the coalition to fill the hole left by Renzi have met little success, leaving Conte no choice but to resign and open a formal government crisis that will give him more time to find a deal.\n\nPresident Sergio Mattarella will start a rapid round of consultations with party leaders on Wednesday afternoon to test the political waters, his office said.\n\nIf he thinks Conte can secure the necessary backing to pull together a new administration, the president will likely give him a few days to try to finalise a deal and draw up a new cabinet.\n\nFinancial markets edged higher despite the latest political tumult, with investors hopeful that Conte might eventually emerge with a more stable government.\n\nUntil now the main coalition parties – the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and centre-left Democratic Party – have backed Conte's efforts to stay in power.\n\n\"Conte is the essential element and we need to broaden and relaunch the government's action,\" Debora Serracchiani, the deputy head of the Democratic Party, told state broadcaster RAI.\n\nHowever, if Conte cannot find new allies, Mattarella will have to come up with an alternative candidate deemed capable of piecing together a workable coalition.\n\nIf all else fails, the president will have to call an election, two years ahead of schedule, although political analysts say this is the least likely scenario.\n\nItaly's coronavirus crisis has triggered its worst recession since World War Two and the government has been struggling to draw up a plan on how best to spend some 200 billion euros of European Union funds to help the economy recover.\n\nRenzi has accused Conte of lacking a strategic vision, saying he risked squandering the unprecedented EU bonanza on handouts rather than long-term investments.\n\nConte is a lawyer with no direct political affiliation, but is close to 5-Star, the largest party in parliament.\n\nOpinion polls show that he's Italy's most popular leader, with an approval rating of 56 percent, almost 20 points above the next closest politician, according to a poll published by Corriere della Sera daily on Saturday.\n\nIf he is ousted from office, political sources have suggested he might try to cash in his popularity by forming his own party or else by taking charge of 5-Star.

I am grateful to now be part of the Chelsea family - it feels amazing!\"\n\nTuchel will take charge for the first time when Wolves visit Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Wednesday.\n\nLampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer as a player, was dismissed on Monday after a run of five defeats in eight league games that saw his side slide to ninth in the table, 11 points behind leaders Manchester United.\n\nThat was not the return Abramovich expected after a £200 million (US$300 million) spending spree in the summer transfer window at a time when most of Europe's top clubs were scaling back due to the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"It is never easy to change head coach in the middle of the season but we are very happy to secure one of Europe's best coaches in Thomas Tuchel,\" said Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. \"There is still much to play for and much to achieve, this season and beyond.\"\n\nTuchel's task will be to get the best out of German compatriots Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, who have struggled to live up to their price tags in their first few months in England.\n\nDespite guiding Paris Saint-Germain to their first Champions League final in August, Tuchel was sacked himself by the French champions last month.\n\nHis falling out with PSG sporting director Leonardo played a large part in that and his habit of fractious relations with his employers does not bode well for his prospects at a club with such a famously impatient owner.\n\n\"Tuchel will be exposed to exactly the same rules as Frank,\" said Lampard's former England team-mate Gary Neville. \"We'll be talking about him being let go in the next 18 months to two years, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n\nTuchel previously held talks with Chelsea over replacing Antonio Conte after he left Dortmund in 2017.\n\nInstead, he ended up in the French capital, where he won back-to-back league titles and ended PSG's run of crashing out the Champions League in the last 16.\n\nChelsea face a daunting last-16 tie when the Champions League returns next month against La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid.\n\nTuchel also has to win round the Chelsea support that have been upset at the handling of Lampard's dismissal.\n\n\"Absolutely gutted. Frank Lampard is, and always will be, a legend of Chelsea Football Club,\" the Chelsea Supporters' Trust tweeted on his departure.\n\nLampard achieved a fourth-place finish in his first season in charge to secure a place in the Champions League despite a transfer ban and the sale of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, his Premier League points-per-game average of 1.67 is the lowest for any Chelsea manager in the Abramovich era.\n\n\"I am disappointed not to have had the time this season to take the club forward and bring it to the next level,\" said Lampard.

He also said cleaners did not seem to have thoroughly cleansed the area after the mass testing had been completed.\n\nInfectious diseases expert Joseph Tsang, meanwhile, said he believes the reason the government imposed a lockdown on the area without prior notice was to prevent residents from fleeing, as some did prior to authorities sealing off an area in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nHe said he believes the government’s “ambush-style lockdown” is aimed at targeting high-risk old buildings and identifying silent carriers as soon as possible.",

The operation ended after 11 hours.\n\nChief Secretary Matthew Cheung also hailed the operation as a success, despite it uncovering just one infection.\n\nHe said authorities would launch more operations of this type in the future.\n\n“In other words, surprise, quick and targeted,” he said.\n\n“I hope the community will understand that we are all doing this in the public interest of Hong Kong, in the interest of everybody.\n\n“We want Hong Kong to get back to normal, and the answer is very simple: we have to really reduce the case to a minimum, acceptable to everybody and public health really comes first.”\n\nLam said the government’s next goal would be “how to better utilise the anti-epidemic tools and stay one step ahead of an outbreak to achieve zero infections in the community.”\n\nShe said the operation could put the minds of the residents at ease, and called on people to get tested as soon as possible whenever they are ordered to do so.",

    "content": "China has administered about 22.8 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, a health official said on Wednesday, as the country steps up its campaign ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holidays and the accompanying flurry of travel.\n\nThe world's most populous nation has widened its targeted inoculation scheme since mid-December to include more priority groups facing higher risk of virus exposure, in a bid to prevent any outbreaks in winter and spring.\n\n\"Overall, the work is progressing in a smooth and orderly manner,\" Zeng Yixin, vice director of the National Health Commission, told a news conference, referring to the vaccination effort.\n\nChina aims to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, state media Global Times said this month.\n\nThe nationwide vaccine scheme now prioritises essential groups such as workers in medical, transport and food services, employees and students going abroad. The elderly and others will have to wait.\n\nHowever, the Chaoyang district in the capital, Beijing, has already started giving vaccines to citizens outside essential groups.\n\nSome communities in the district of Dongcheng said residents aged between 18 and 59 can sign up for inoculation as long as they have no medical conditions that might make vaccination unsuitable. But they did not say when doses would be available. (Reuters)",

    "content": "Representatives of the tourism sector on Wednesday called on the government to hire unemployed workers in their industry for temporary positions, such as helpers at vaccination centres or guides at country parks.\n\nFour associations under the Federation of Trade Unions say around 15,000 to 20,000 workers in the sector have become unemployed since the pandemic began. They say many are using up all their savings as well as subsidies the government provided them last year.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Hong Kong Industry Employees General Union, Sara Leung, urged the government to hire tour guides or other former workers in the industry to help with vaccination efforts.\n\nLeung said vaccinating the city’s population would require a lot of manpower, and not everyone involved would need to be a medical professional.\n\nShe said former tourism sector workers could help give directions, provide general information to those getting inoculated, and assist in cleaning.\n\nAnd instead of hiring former civil servants – who may well be enjoying their retirement benefits – Leung said the government could ease the city’s unemployment situation by giving tourism workers a way to make ends meet.\n\nShe said with their customer service skills, tourism workers will be able to get on with their new jobs quickly.\n\n“If they are allowed to take up duties like crowd-control management, promotion, or simple customer service, they can take things up very easily… this could allow the government to save time and resources to train staff,” Leung said.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Hong Kong Professional Tourist Guides General Union, Ann Yu, said she hopes the Environmental Protection Department and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department could hire tourism workers as environmental ambassadors.\n\nShe said they could provide information to hikers and users of country parks and make sure people would protect the environment and not leave behind rubbish.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Hong Kong Certified Tour Escort Association, Stephen Chan, said the government could recruit tourism workers to promote its scheme that encourages stores to install e-payment systems.\n\nThe government rolled out a scheme to provide a one-off HK$5,000 subsidy to retailers and restaurants in public housing estates to set up e-payment methods last October, so people would not need to pay using cash – which could help spread the virus.\n\nBut Chan said the scheme had received lukewarm support due to a lack of promotion and he urged the government to hire tourism workers on a temporary basis to promote it.",

    "content": "Relatives of Wuhan's coronavirus dead on Wednesday said Chinese authorities have deleted their social media group and are pressuring them to keep quiet while a World Health Organization team is in the city to investigate the pandemic's origins.\n\nScores of relatives have banded together online in a shared quest for accountability from Wuhan officials who they blame for mishandling the outbreak that tore through the city one year ago.\n\nThe effort has thus far been thwarted by official obstruction, monitoring of social media groups and intimidation, say next-of-kin.\n\nBut pressure has escalated in recent days, apparently to muzzle any criticism and avoid embarrassment during the highly sensitive WHO investigation.\n\nA group on social media platform WeChat used by 80 to 100 family members over the past year was suddenly deleted without explanation about 10 days ago, said Zhang Hai, a group member and a vocal critic of the outbreak's handling.\n\n\"This shows that (Chinese authorities) are very nervous. They are afraid that these families will get in touch with the WHO experts,\" said Zhang, 51, whose father died early in the pandemic of suspected Covid-19.\n\nThe WHO experts arrived in Wuhan on January 14 and are due to emerge from a 14-day quarantine on Thursday.\n\nOther next-of-kin confirmed the group's deletion. WeChat is operated by Chinese digital giant Tencent.\n\nRelatives accuse the Wuhan and Hubei provincial governments of allowing Covid-19 to explode out of control by trying to conceal the outbreak when it first emerged in the city in December 2019, then failing to alert the public and bungling the response.\n\nAccording to official Chinese figures, it killed nearly 3,900 in Wuhan, accounting for the vast majority of the 4,636 dead China has reported.\n\nMany next-of-kin distrust those numbers, saying the scarcity of testing in the outbreak's chaotic early days meant many are likely to have died without being confirmed as having the disease.\n\nWhile China has broadly controlled the pandemic on its soil, it has frustrated independent attempts to trace its origins.\n\nInstead, it has sought to deflect blame for the horrific worldwide human and economic toll by suggesting, without proof, that it emerged elsewhere.\n\nAnother family member, a retiree who says her adult daughter died of the virus last January, said she was summoned last week by authorities and warned not to \"speak to media or be used by others\".\n\nAuthorities came to her door on Tuesday \"and sang the same old tune and gave me 5,000 yuan (US$775) in a 'condolence payment'\", she added, requesting anonymity.

But seven face the same direction.\n\nAs for the congee shop at United Building on Bulkeley Street in Hung Hom, six workers have come down with Covid-19 and a seventh has tested preliminary positive. It's a family business and a family of four are among those infected.\n\nOther staff have been sent into quarantine, and no customers have been infected so far.\n\nBut Chuang said people who have been there recently should go take a test.\n\n\"If there are so many colleagues and workers affected in the shop, there is bound to be some risks for the visitors of shop. That's why we asked the general public who had visited the shop to get tested,\" Chuang told the daily Covid press conference.\n\nShe said the source of infection at the shop was unknown. The first patient showed symptoms on Monday last week.\n\nResidents of more buildings are now subject to mandatory Covid testing. They are in Ho Man Tin, To Kwa Wan, Tuen Mun, Kwai Chung, Tin Shui Wai and Sai Wan Ho, as well as buildings in Yau Ma Tei and Jordan that were already in the designated areas for compulsory tests.",

Experts say they believe the narrow light well helped spread the virus vertically, and infected people living in various floors.\n\nAfter inspecting the 56-year-old building on Wednesday, University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said while the pipes are in good condition, the building's design in terms of ventilation is not ideal, as it was built a long time ago.\n\n\"If the residents don't open their windows while their exhaust fans are on, the heat wave will easily go up [the light well] and create vertical transmission,\" Yuen told reporters.\n\n\"Some residents also told us there was odd smell in their toilets from time to time. They believe it too come from the the light well. So we have reason to believe there is a danger to residents of C-6 and C-7 if they continue to stay there.\"\n\nYuen urged authorities to do another round of tests for all other residents in the block, noting only around half of the 400 residents had complied with a compulsory testing order.\n\nYuen also warned virus could spread quickly in old buildings, noting North Point is an old district like Yau Ma Tei.\n\nHe also called on residents in other blocks of Tung Fat Building to get tested.",

The foreign policy direction of the new US administration, developments of the China-US relations, as well as the implementation of the Brexit agreement will all have impact on the financial markets.\n\n\"The persisting low interest rate environment could also bring additional challenges to our equity and bond holdings.\"\n\nHe said the authority will manage the fund prudently and maintain a high degree of liquidity of its assets.",

But at the same time, he pledged Beijing’s full backing for Hong Kong in its fight against Covid, and expressed confidence that the city can surely overcome this challenge.\n\nLam also made a duty report to Premier Li Keqiang, while Macau leader Ho Iat-seng also delivered virtual work reports to state leaders.\n\nPhotos released by the central government showed Lam flanked by the head of the Beijing Liaison Office, Luo Huining, and director of the CE Office, Eric Chan.\n\nVice Premier Han Zheng, who's in charge of Hong Kong affairs, and the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, were also in attendance.",

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, whose governments decide on their own measures, are also under various restrictions.\n\nBritain has begun a vaccination programme aimed at delivering shots to 15 million people in priority groups by the middle of February.\n\nJohnson told parliament he hoped that would allow schools to begin reopening the following month.\n\n\"We hope it will therefore be safe to begin the reopening of schools from Monday the 8th of March, with other economic and social restrictions being removed (then or) thereafter, as and when the data permits,\" he said.\n\nBritain has banned travellers from 22 high-risk nations, where new coronavirus variants have emerged, such as South Africa and some in South America, or may be present, like Portugal.\n\nThe government said new measures would mean travellers to Britain from those countries who could not be refused entry would now have to quarantine for 10 days in government-provided accommodation.\n\nThose wishing to leave Britain will need to explain why in a declaration checked before departure, with vacations not an acceptable reason, said Home Secretary Priti Patel. More police will be on duty at ports and airports to send home people who had no valid reason for travel.\n\n\"People should simply not be travelling,\" she told parliament, citing cases of people turning up at a London train station with skis.\n\n\"That is clearly not acceptable.

Our task is to organise Olympic Games, not to cancel Olympic Games... and that is why we will not add fuel to this speculation.\"\n\nBach said while the complexity of organising the Games had increased as a result of the virus, \"we just have to ask for patience and understanding, is the main message\".\n\n\"I think it is too early to decide anything else,\" he added.\n\nAfter the last executive board meeting, the IOC released a statement on December 12, the same day the Pfizer vaccine was approved in the United States, expressing its \"full commitment\" to staging the Games.\n\nSince then, the emergence of more infectious virus strains has sparked debate on whether the Games can take place and whether it is morally justifiable that competitors be prioritised for vaccination.\n\n\"We always have made it clear that we are not in favour of athletes jumping the queue,\" Bach stressed.\n\nThe German said the IOC was constantly accumulating knowledge on how to organise such a huge event in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\"There is no blueprint, we're learning every day,\" Bach said.\n\nHe said he understood how people living under lockdown and perhaps unable to even visit a restaurant because of Covid-19 restrictions found it hard to envisage the Games going ahead.\n\n\"The responsibility of the (Japanese) government and the IOC is to look beyond this situation,\" Bach added.\n\nAnd, citing the ongoing world handball championships in Egypt -- a country he said was deemed high-risk for virus infections -- Bach said it was right for the IOC to continue looking to hold the Games.\n\n\"We are able and in a position to offer relevant counter-measures,\" he said. \"If we would think it wasn't responsible, or the Games could not be safe, we would not go for it.\"\n\nBach also announced the release of the first version of a \"playbook\" explaining the \"many measures we can imagine to be applied in July and August in Tokyo\".\n\nThe document, he said, was \"a huge undertaking under daily review\" and covered essential issues such as immigration, potential quarantines, transportation in Tokyo, living in the Olympic Village and social distancing.\n\nOfficials have long floated the idea that the Games could go ahead without spectators.\n\nIt is an idea many sportspeople have backed, as long as they get a tilt at an Olympic medal.\n\n\"I want fans to be there, but the most important thing for a player is for the event to go ahead and be able to play,\" Japanese table tennis star Mima Ito told AFP.\n\nAustralia and Canada -- who both pulled their teams before the initial postponement of the Games last year -- and the United States have come out in support of the rescheduled Olympics.\n\nGreek pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi -- who led calls for last year's postponement -- has said she would prefer the Olympics to be held with no fans than not at all.\n\nTop US gymnast Simone Biles said the decision had to be based on \"what's safe for the world\", but added she was \"hoping the Olympics can be put on, even if it means we're in a bubble\".\n\nBut Japanese gymnastics star Kohei Uchimura sounded a note of caution, saying the event \"can't be held if the athletes and the people don't feel the same way\".

    "content": "Vietnam's health ministry on Thursday confirmed its first two locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in nearly two months, just weeks before the Lunar New Year holiday period, when big gatherings indoors are expected.\n\nThough a tiny number compared with new coronavirus infections in many countries, the two cases are a jolt for Vietnam. Thanks to strict quarantine, testing and tracing measures, it has reported only 1,551 cases and 35 Covid-19 deaths before Thursday, earning it a top three spot in a survey of how well countries have handled the pandemic.\n\nOn Thursday, Vietnam's health ministry ordered provinces and state agencies to tighten screening and controls.\n\nContact tracing efforts were launched in two northern provinces Hai Duong and Quang Ninh, where the two new infections were detected - one of which was linked to the new UK variant of the virus - and a village in Hai Duong was locked down, according to state media. The UK variant has been determined to be much more easily transmissible.\n\n\"We have to make all efforts to locate the infected areas within 10 days to put down the outbreak,\" Vu Duc Dam, head of the national Covid-19 task force said in a health ministry statement.\n\nIn awkward timing for the country's government, the two new cases also came as the ruling Communist Party gathers in Hanoi for its five-yearly congress to pick new leadership, with 1,600 delegates from across Vietnam in attendance.\n\nOn Thursday, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc convened a meeting on the sidelines of the congress with the national Covid-19 taskforce to discuss the new outbreak. The wearing of face masks was also made compulsory at the congress venue for the first time since it kicked off on Monday.\n\nThe latest patients include a support staff worker at Van Don international airport who was responsible for taking infected passengers arriving from abroad to Covid-19 quarantine facilities.\n\nThe other case is a factory worker who came into contact with a Vietnamese national who later travelled to Japan and tested positive there for the new UK variant of the virus, which has been determined to be much more easily transmissible.\n\n\"The airport staff worker has been to several public places, including hospital,\" the health ministry said in its statement.\n\n\"For the factory worker case, considering its involvement with the UK variant, contact tracing has to be done as fast as possible but in a very cautious and careful manner.\"\n\nVietnam's stringent anti-coronavirus steps helped quickly contain its early coronavirus outbreaks, allowing it to resume its economic activities earlier than much of Asia.\n\nA first wave of infections was crushed in April, and the country went nearly 100 days without local transmission until the reappearance of the virus in the central city of Danang in July. Further cases were detected in business hub Ho Chi Minh City in early December.\n\nIt has effectively closed its borders to combat the coronavirus and has suspended inbound flights from countries with new Covid-19 variants, initially Britain and South Africa.

    "content": "A representative of the funeral industry says a potential lockdown in an area of Hung Hom would affect more than 60 funeral businesses and their daily work.\n\nAuthorities have marked the area bordered by Station Lane, Dock Street, Po Loi Street, Winslow Street, Hung Hom Road South and Chatham Road North as a zone where stricter than usual Covid testing rules apply.\n\nThe area will see tests ordered for all residents if their block has just one known infection, or if Covid-19 is found in sewage samples taken from the buildings.\n\nHealth officials put another 20 buildings under mandatory testing orders on Wednesday, 11 of them in Hung Hom.\n\nNg Yiu-tong, the permanent president of the Funeral Business Association said on Thursday that the funeral shops in the area handle around 50 to 60 bodies per day, and any \"ambush-style lockdown\" there would leave them unable to do their work.\n\nNg said delaying funerals would add to the sorrow of bereaved families.\n\n“If you miss a scheduled time, neither money nor time can compensate the family’s sorrow. How do you give them another schedule? It is very difficult,” he said.\n\nNg said authorities had not approached them to discuss the matter, and some workers in the industry have already moved some of their funeral items to other locations, so they could at least continue to carry out some of their work if a sudden lockdown was imposed.\n\nThe association leader said he understands that officials want to keep their operations secret, but he hopes they could exercise some discretion during any lockdown and allow workers in the funeral industry to enter a sealed-off area to collect items when necessary.",

    "content": "An infectious diseases expert said on Thursday that authorities need to conduct testing and tracing for coronavirus much quicker – warning that a failure to bring Covid-19 numbers sharply down in the next two weeks would lead to another rise in infections after the Lunar New Year.\n\nUniversity of Hong Kong professor Ho Pak-leung said quick contact tracing of people linked to a coronavirus outbreak at a congee shop in Hung Hom was of paramount importance.\n\nHo said the outbreak there – which has seen six workers at the shop come down with Covid-19 while a seventh has tested preliminary positive – could lead to another large-scale outbreak.\n\n\"The transmission didn't happen in the past two days, but a week ago perhaps... a lot of customers could've been infected already,\" Ho said.\n\n\"It's a high-risk cluster that could lead to another community outbreak,” he warned. “If the authorities don't do their work quickly, they will only be chasing after the virus forever.”\n\n“Locking down a neighbourhood by then is not a preventive strategy, it's only used to repair the damage already done,” he said.\n\nHo said the situation in the city is “very worrying”, and recent outbreaks show the virus is still very active in the community.\n\nHo said it was inevitable that more people would go out and have family gatherings during Chinese New Year – and this could trigger a further rise in cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the Environment Secretary, Wong Kam-sing, said the government had boosted its capacity to collect and test sewage samples to detect the presence of coronavirus.\n\nHe said officials are collecting samples from more than 20 locations in four districts each day.\n\nHe described the sewage test as a ”radar\", but admitted that the results could be affected by various factors, such as whether sewage pipes are properly connected.\n\nHe said even if the sewage samples test negative for the virus, it can still be present in the residential buildings.",

So I think that Hong Kong people should really, looking back over the last year, give ourselves a pat on the back. Well done,\" he said.\n\n\"What we need now is to have that same sense of solidarity... despite our differences that we want to collectively protect everybody and go back to some sort of normality,\" he said.\n\nLeung also called on the authorities to remain open and scientific about the vaccination programme to earn people's trust, adding that HKU plans to help run a vaccination centre after the Lunar New Year.",

    "content": "A team of experts from the World Health Organization left quarantine in Wuhan on Thursday to begin a heavily scrutinised probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, after Washington urged a \"robust and clear\" investigation.\n\nThe group started a two-week quarantine on arrival on January 14 in the central Chinese city where the first known cluster of virus cases emerged in late 2019.\n\nWearing masks, they peered at the ranks of waiting media from the window of a bus which whisked them from the quarantine hotel – although it was not immediately clear when and where their investigation will start.\n\nThe virus is believed to have come from bats and to have initially spread from a wet market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold as food.\n\nThe WHO insists the visit will be tightly tethered to the science of how the virus – which has killed more than two million people and laid waste to the global economy – jumped from animals to humans.\n\nBut in a sign of the political baggage attached to their mission, US President Joe Biden's new administration weighed in before the experts had even left their hotel.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, new White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was \"imperative we get to the bottom\" of how the virus appeared and spread worldwide. Psaki voiced concern over \"misinformation\" from \"some sources in China\" and urged a \"robust and clear\" probe.\n\nIn a mission dogged by delays and obfuscation from their Chinese hosts, it was not clear what the expert team will be allowed to see in Wuhan – or what useful evidence remains a year after the outbreak in a country which has vigorously controlled the narrative of how the pandemic began.\n\nThe early days of the outbreak remain among the most sensitive topics in China today, with the Communist leadership seeking to stamp out any discussion that shows its governance in a poor light.\n\nBeijing has also sought to seed doubt into the origin story, floating the unsubstantiated theory that the virus emerged elsewhere.\n\nAnother theory, amplified by former US President Donald Trump, is that it leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan where researchers were studying coronaviruses.\n\nRelatives of Wuhan's coronavirus dead have called for a meeting with the team from the UN health agency, saying they have been facing new levels of official obstruction since the WHO team arrived. They accuse the Chinese government of taking down a WeChat group used by scores of next-of-kin to discuss the outbreak shortly after the WHO team arrived.\n\nAccording to official Chinese figures, the virus killed nearly 3,900 in Wuhan, accounting for the vast majority of the 4,636 dead China has reported.\n\nA panel of independent experts concluded this month that China and the WHO could have acted more quickly to avert catastrophe during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak.

Now I just come back now and I see like this, it's very scary.\"\n\nEastern district councillor Lee Yue-shun of the Civic Party, who represents the area, told RTHK that some residents were anxious about the lockdown.\n\nHe said authorities should take into consideration how the operation posed inconvenience to residents, such as the issue of hygiene.\n\n“In this kind of old district, the clearance of rubbish really relies on the private contractor to collect all the rubbish on different floors of that building,” Lee said.\n\n“If you lock down there overnight, there is nobody to handle the rubbish that has been accumulated for a day. I think the government has to be more considerate on some elderly and children, to let them go through the process in a more comfortable way.”\n\nMeanwhile, infectious disease expert Leung Chi-chiu said the lockdown should have come earlier.\n\nHe said many residents had already moved out after Covid cases were reported there, and the operation may not be effective in stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nAuthorities said on Thursday that if residents had taken coronavirus tests in the past two days, they can be exempt from getting tested again during the lockdown as long as they can show relevant proof.\n\nBut they need to stay and wait at their homes until the others are tested.\n\nA compulsory testing order was issued earlier for residents of Block C, but microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung of the University of Hong Kong said on Wednesday he believed only about half of the residents there have complied.\n\nAt least 13 confirmed or preliminary positive cases have been reported from Block C of the 56-year-old Tung Fat Building, and residents of units 6 and 7 were sent to quarantine centres.\n\nExperts said they believed the narrow light well at Block C helped spread the virus vertically and infected people living on various floors.\n\nOn Tuesday, a number of buildings on Pitt Street and Tung On Street in Yau Ma Tei were locked down, with more than 300 residents tested for Covid and one infection recorded.",

    "content": "Stuck in the grip of a viral pandemic, the US economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2020 and shrank last year by the largest amount in 74 years.\n\nFor 2020 as a whole, a year when the coronavirus inflicted the worst economic freeze since the end of World War II, the economy contracted 3.5 percent and clouded the outlook for the coming year. The economic damage followed the eruption of the pandemic 10 months ago and the deep recession it triggered, with tens of millions of Americans left jobless.\n\nThursday's report from the Commerce Department estimated that the nation's gross domestic product slowed sharply in the October-December quarter from a record 33.4 percent surge in the July-September quarter. That gain had followed a record-shattering annual plunge of 33.4 percent in the April-June quarter, when the economy sank into a freefall.\n\nThe pandemic's blow to the economy early last spring ended the longest U.S. economic expansion on record – early 11 years. The damage from the virus caused GDP to contract at a 5 percent annual rate in last year's January-March quarter. Since then, thousands of businesses have closed, nearly 10 million people remain out of work and more than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus.\n\nThe estimated drop in GDP for 2020 was the first such decline since a 2.5 percent fall in 2009, during the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. That was the deepest annual setback since the economy shrank 11.6 percent in 1946, when the economy was demobilising after World War II.\n\nThe most catastrophic annual contraction in records dating to 1930 was a 12.9 percent fall in 1932 during the Great Depression.\n\nThe government's report on Thursday was its first of three estimates of growth last quarter; the figure will be revised twice in the coming weeks.\n\nThe outlook for the 2021 economy remains hazy. Economists warn that a sustained recovery won't likely take hold until vaccines are distributed and administered nationwide and government-enacted rescue aid spreads through the economy, a process likely to take months.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve took note of the economic threats. It kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low near zero and stressed that it would keep pursuing its low-rate policies until a recovery is well underway.\n\nThe Fed acknowledged that the economy has faltered in recent months, with hiring weakening especially in industries affected by the raging pandemic, notably restaurants, bars, hotels and others involved in face-to-face public contact.\n\nHiring in the US has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April. The job market has sputtered as the pandemic and colder weather have discouraged Americans from travelling, shopping, dining out or visiting entertainment venues. Retail sales have declined for three straight months.\n\nLast month, the government enacted a US$900 billion rescue aid package, and President Joe Biden is pushing for lawmakers to follow up by approving his US$1.9 trillion plan for further economic help. Biden’s proposal has met resistance, though, from many Republicans who contend that the cost is too high and some of its benefits misplaced.\n\nMany economists warn that without further support, the economy risks succumbing to another recession. They note that much of the aid for individuals from the US$900 billion package is set to expire in mid-March.\n\n“The economy is still struggling,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “How strong the economy is later this year will depend on how the virus evolves and the effectiveness of the vaccines and mitigation efforts.”\n\nZandi predicted that the economy will expand at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the current quarter and achieve annual growth rates later this year above 5 percent. But he cautioned that his forecast is based on the enactment of further federal economic relief, and he expects Biden initially to win congressional approval for only about half his US$1.9 trillion proposal.\n\nAbout 5 million jobs, Zandi estimates, will never return, forcing the unemployed in such industries as restaurants and bars to find work in other sectors.\n\n“We have lost so many low-paying service jobs at restaurants, hotels and in transportation,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics and business professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

    "content": "England opener Rory Burns said on Thursday that it was \"important\" to educate players - including the national team - about racism in cricket after a survey revealed many black and Asian professionals felt they were being targeted.\n\nThe Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) said more than a third of black, Asian and minority players in the professional game had experienced racism from other players, fans and social media.\n\nThe PCA and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will begin an education programme in March for all domestic teams as well as national squads.\n\n\"All we can do to keep it relevant and keep people aware of the issues that are going on in the game is important,\" Burns, who is in quarantine in India ahead of the four-Test series, told reporters.\n\n\"And it is great to see that the PCA and the ECB are having initiatives to actually educate players, so we can really get on board with it.\n\n\"Anything that increases the diversity and inclusivity is only a positive thing to me.\"\n\nBurns, who has been taking a course in psychology, is in quarantine with the other England players in the southern Indian city of Chennai where the first two games of the four-Test series will be played.\n\nThe 30-year-old Surrey opener missed England's 2-0 sweep of the Tests in Sri Lanka this month due to the birth of his daughter but is expected to start practice on Sunday with Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes who have also joined up with the squad.\n\nCricket is the latest sport to highlight racism after 23 of 173 PCA members who took part in the survey said they had been a target.\n\nTwenty-four of the 173 were black, Asian and minority ethnic and of those, 12 said they had experienced racism.\n\nTen of the 12 are current professionals. The PCA said this means 38 per cent of black, Asian and minority professionals had been affected.\n\nThe ECB said in November it would take measures aimed at increasing diversity in the game.\n\n\"Racism in the game is unacceptable and the game needs to take action,\" PCA chief executive Rob Lynch said.\n\n\"There is plenty of work to be done in the fight for equality.\"\n\nEngland players did take a knee along with the touring West Indies to support the Black Lives Matter campaign when cricket resumed after the coronavirus lockdown in July.

    "content": "A portrait by Italian renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli sold for US$92 million at an online Sotheby's auction on Thursday, smashing the record price for the artist.\n\n\"Young Man Holding a Roundel,\" believed to have been painted in the 1470s or 1480s, is considered one of Botticelli's finest portraits and is the highlight of Sotheby's Masters Week sale in New York.\n\n\"This is a work that transcends time and categories. Now we really do know the price of beauty,\" said George Wachter, co-chairman of old master paintings at Sotheby's.\n\nThe 23-inch by 15.5-inch (58-centimetre by 39-centimetre) painting shows a man in his late teenage years with long golden hair sitting holding a disc featuring a bearded saint.\n\nThe roundel, which depicts the saint with his right hand raised, is an original 14th-century artwork attributed to Sienese painter Bartolommeo Bulgarini.\n\nArt historians suspect the Botticelli depicts a nobleman proudly showing off the earlier artwork.\n\n\"This image symbolises and exemplifies the Renaissance in Florence,\" Christopher Apostle, Sotheby's senior vice president, said ahead of the auction.\n\n\"We haven't seen anything like it in my lifetime,\" he added, describing it as \"a masterpiece.\"\n\nThe auction, which took place virtually and was streamed live online because of the coronavirus pandemic, saw fierce bidding between Sotheby's representatives in New York and London, with a buyer directing orders through London winning out.\n\nSotheby's said the final price, including fees and commissions, was US$92.2 million after it sold under the hammer for US$80 million.\n\nThe price establishes the work as one of the most significant portraits to have ever sold at auction.\n\nIt becomes the second most valuable old master painting ever auctioned after Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvator Mundi\" went for US$450.3 million at a Christie's sale in 2017.\n\nThursday's price ranks alongside Gustav Klimt's \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II,\" which sold for US$87.9 million in 2006 and Vincent Van Gogh's \"Portrait of Dr Gachet,\" which fetched US$82.5 million in 1990.\n\nIt is also the highest auction sale for a work of art in almost two years since Claude Monet's \"Grainstacks,\" sold for US$110.7 million in May 2019.\n\nThe previous record for a Botticelli was set in 2013 when \"Madonna and Child with Young Saint John the Baptist\" sold for US$10.4 million.\n\n\"Young Man Holding a Roundel\" was handed down through several generations of an aristocratic family in Wales for around 200 years.\n\nArt scholars were unaware of the painting's existence until it first appeared on the market in the early 20th century.\n\nIt has spent much of the last 40 years on public display since New York real estate magnate Sheldon Solow acquired it in 1982 for just 810,000 pounds (US$1.1 million at 2021 rates).\n\nIt has appeared at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London and elsewhere.\n\nThe auction house said \"Young Man Holding a Roundel\" is as significant as Botticelli's \"Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder\" and \"Portrait of Giuliano de' Medici.\"\n\nBotticelli, who lived from the 1440s to 1510, is one of the most celebrated painters of the early Renaissance period, but only about a dozen examples of his work survive today.\n\nHis best-known works are \"The Birth of Venus\" and \"Primavera.\"\n\n\"I think we underestimate how groundbreaking he was,\" said Apostle.\n\nThe Sotheby's sale was also due to sell Rembrandt's \"Abraham and the Angels\" for up to US$30 million but it was withdrawn shortly before the auction.\n\nIt has been in private collections for 150 years and last sold at auction in 1848, for a mere US$64.

Tension between the two superpowers hit a boiling point at the United Nations last year, under former US President Donald Trump's administration, over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I hope we will see a reset in relations between the United States and China,\" Guterres told reporters. \"It is clear that in human rights, there are two completely different views, and it is clear that in human rights there is no scope for an agreement or a common vision.\"\n\n\"There is an area where I believe there is a growing convergence of interests, and my appeal is for that area to be pursued by the two sides, together with the whole of the international community, and that area is climate action,\" he said.\n\nNew US President Joe Biden's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations accused China on Wednesday of trying to \"drive an authoritarian agenda\" at the 193-member world body.\n\nWhen asked for a response, Guterres said: \"In relation to the United Nations I can guarantee that we are very strongly committed to make sure that the UN is a beacon of all the values are related to ... security, development, human rights.\"\n\nGuterres also said he was \"particularly worried\" about the power of social media companies and that a regulatory framework should be created so decisions such as banning Trump from Twitter can be done \"in line with law.\" (Reuters)",

Residents will have to get tested if there is just a single infection reported in their building.\n\nIn a statement, the Home Affairs Department said the authorities had checked 220 residents and those who hadn't followed the order were again told to undergo testing. It warned that those who fail to comply could face a larger fine of HK$25,000 and six months in prison.\n\nThe department said it may conduct another round of inspections in the future.\n\nIt added that it realises that such enforcement operations may cause inconvenience to residents, and appealed for people's understanding.",

    "content": "The European Union's contract with AstraZeneca for its Covid-19 vaccine contains binding orders, EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, as the bloc continues to press the drugmaker to deliver supplies as promised.\n\nThe EU has been locked in a row with AstraZeneca, which partnered with Britain's Oxford University to develop its vaccine, after the drugmaker said last week it would cut deliveries in the first quarter due to production issues at a Belgian factory.\n\nAn EU official said that meant the EU would receive 31 million doses in the period, or 60 percent less than initially agreed, piling pressure on the 27-country bloc which has lagged vaccination campaigns in Israel, Britain and the United States.\n\n\"There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,\" von der Leyen told Deutschlandfunk radio, adding it contained clear delivery amounts for December and the first three quarters of 2021.\n\n\"AstraZeneca has also explicitly assured us in this contract that no other obligations would prevent the contract from being fulfilled,\" she added.\n\nVon der Leyen's comments contradict statements by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who told newspapers on Tuesday the EU contract was based on a \"best-effort\" clause and did not commit the company to a specific timetable for deliveries.\n\nSoriot has also said the EU was late to strike a supply contract so the company did not have enough time to iron out production problems at a vaccine factory run by a partner in Belgium.\n\nVon der Leyen said the \"best-effort\" cause was only valid as long as it was not clear whether AstraZeneca could develop a vaccine. She also said there was no \"order sequencing\" stipulation and that it mentioned four production sites, two of which are in Britain.\n\nThe EU wants to make a redacted version of the contract public later on Friday, she said.\n\nThe EU contract with AstraZeneca is an advance purchase agreement for the supply of at least 300 million doses provided the vaccine is approved as safe and effective, with doses delivered in stages. It is expected to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Friday. (Reuters)",

    "content": "The Hong Kong economy has taken a record beating amid Covid-19.\n\nThe economy shrank 6.1 percent in 2020, the worst annual economic performance ever.\n\nIt's the second straight year the economy has contracted. GDP fell by 1.2 percent in 2019.\n\nIn 1998, battered by the Asian financial crisis, the economy shrank 5.9 percent.\n\nAccording to advance estimates released by the government on Friday, GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010 dropped by 3 percent from the same period the year before. That's a slight improvement from a 3.6 percent contraction in the three months ending September.\n\nA government spokesman said the pace of recovery in the October-to-December period was slow because of the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs for the entire year, the government said while social stability was restored in Hong Kong, the 6.1 percent contraction was mainly due to the fallout from the pandemic, with consumption- and tourism-related sectors such as accommodation, food services and retail trade hit the hardest.\n\nBy contrast, financial market activity stayed robust and activities relating to exports and imports of goods picked up visibly in recent periods.\n\nThe government expects the economy to return to growth this year, but said recovery is subject to uncertainties.\n\n\"I would rather look at quarter-on-quarter growth and also the actual level of GDP. Those two numbers will really tell the truth,\" said Iris Pang, ING’s chief economist for Greater China.\n\n\"This year, in Q1 and Q2, we expect actually 5 percent year-on-year growth but that doesn't mean anything. It is purely a negative base effect\" because of declines of around 9 percent in each of those quarters, she said.\n\nPang also said she doesn't expect international travel to resume until later in the year, further clouding the city's economic outlook.",

    "content": "The EU's medicines regulator on Friday gave AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine the green light to be used on adults of all ages, saying it believed it would be safe for older people too.\n\nAll eyes had been on whether the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would follow the lead of Germany, which on Wednesday declined to recommend the vaccine for over-65s, citing insufficient data.\n\n\"EMA has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 in people from 18 years of age,\" the Amsterdam-based EMA said in a statement.\n\nThe watchdog said that there were \"not yet enough results in older participants\" over 55 to show how it would work, but that \"protection was expected\" as an immune response was found in them, and based on experience with other vaccines.\n\n\"EMA's scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults,\" it said.\n\n\"More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants.\"\n\nThe EMA has already approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs for the 27-nation European Union, plus the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nThe deployment of British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca's vaccine has been awaited with impatience by European countries as it is cheaper to produce than its rivals, and easier to stock and transport.\n\nAn age limit on the jab, developed with Oxford University, would have been a blow for governments that have based their vaccination campaigns on prioritising the frail and elderly.\n\nAstraZeneca has defended its vaccine's efficacy for all ages, along with Britain, which has already used the shot widely on older people.\n\nCasting a shadow over the EMA decision is the bitter row over the supply of AstraZeneca doses between the EU and Britain.\n\nThe firm says there is not enough to go around as production issues have slowed promised deliveries.\n\nThe European Commission published a redacted copy of its contract with the drugs giant on Friday, demanding the company meet its prior commitments.\n\nThe EMA has meanwhile been under huge pressure to authorise vaccines as quickly as possible as frustration and pressure grow over Europe's stumbling start to the inoculation campaign.\n\nWhile it has been working under what it calls an \"accelerated timeline\", the watchdog insists that ensuring safety and efficacy are paramount.\n\nAstraZeneca formally applied for authorisation on January 12. The EMA had already been carrying out a \"rolling review\" of data on the vaccine since October.\n\nOxford and AstraZeneca had previously been criticised over a lack of clarity and transparency on trials that had shown varying outcomes in the jab's efficiency.\n\nThe EMA reached the decision after a four-day meeting of its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which gathers experts from all EU and EEA countries.\n\nFormal authorisation must be granted by the European Commission in Brussels but that could come within hours.\n\nThe EMA said separately on Friday that it had found no link between the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and a number of deaths of older people.

The aim is to provide us immediately with full transparency.... And if needed, it also will provide us with a tool to ensure vaccine deliveries.\"\n\nEU officials said they expected the order to come into effect on Saturday after its publication in the official journal.\n\nThe emergency measure is initially for six weeks but is intended to then continue until at least the end of March.\n\nThe WHO said the move was part of a \"very worrying trend\" that could jeopardise the global supply chain for vaccines.\n\n\"It is not helpful to have any country at this stage putting export bans or export barriers that will not allow for the free movement of the necessary ingredients that will make vaccines, diagnostics and other medicines available to all the world,\" said Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director for access to medicines and health product.\n\nThe EU's plan applies only to those coronavirus vaccines that are covered by advance purchase agreements between drug companies and the European Commission.\n\nThose firms in the EU will have to apply for an authorisation to export doses meant for countries outside the bloc, and show their export records for the previous three months.\n\nA response would normally be given within 48 hours, though that could be extended if necessary.\n\nMost non-EU countries in and around Europe, such as Switzerland, those in the Balkans or micro-states like Monaco, are exempted from the measure.\n\nBut Britain, which last year left the EU amid much acrimony, is not.\n\nBrussels has been in a furious dispute with AstraZeneca this week, accusing it of breaching its contract by delaying deliveries to EU governments while maintaining those under a deal it signed earlier with the UK.\n\nBut Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides insisted: \"We are not protecting ourselves against any specific country. And we're not in competition or in a race against any country.\"\n\nThe prior three-month reporting period would presumably reveal whether or not AstraZeneca did indeed - as has been alleged - send vaccines to Britain from its vaccine plants in Europe, which it says have since been hit by production glitches.\n\nBelgian authorities on Thursday searched one AstraZeneca plant in southern Belgium at the European Commission's request. Data seized is being analysed.\n\nEU officials insisted that the scheme is not targeting AstraZeneca alone, but all Covid vaccine-exporting firms tied to the Commission by contracts.\n\nThe main goal, they said, was to gather information, though they admitted that in \"certain circumstances\" vaccine exports could be denied.\n\n\"What we want to achieve is of course, a fair approach. And transparency will help us in that respect,\" said one official on condition of anonymity.\n\nVaccines, he said, are \"a very strategic product, at a very delicate time\".\n\nThe officials noted that the EU's vaccine procurement portfolio is for 2.5 billion doses of authorised and potential vaccines - more than enough for the bloc's 450 million inhabitants.\n\nThat is because the Commission also bought on behalf of poorer countries, with its excess doses to be funnelled through the WHO-led Covax facility.\n\n\"We're not talking about vaccine nationalism,\" one official said. \"From the beginning we intended to share these vaccines with our neighbours.\"\n\nRight now, though, the EU's vaccination programme is flagging badly, triggering anger among member states.\n\nOn Britain not being exempted from the export-authorisation scheme, one EU official said: \"The United Kingdom does not belong to either the Covax countries nor to the Efta (EU-linked European Free Trade Association) countries, nor to the neighbourhood.\" (AFP)",

Media reports said this could include vaccines manufactured by another mainland drug company, Sinopharm, with final stage data also pending.\n\nBoth firms have handed in trial data to the World Health Organization, which is now reviewing the vaccines for emergency use, although they have already been used in vaccination programmes on the mainland.\n\nInfectious diseases specialist Professor Ivan Hung said he believed both companies would soon provide the necessary data. Hung, who is on the government advisory panel for Covid-19 vaccines, said Hong Kong's strong health service meant it could wait a little longer.\n\n\"We have to wait for the phase three results. I think the phase three results will be very, very important for the advisory panel to assess the safety, as well as the efficacy of the vaccine. There is no rush for us to jump in. We have time, and our health system remains very robust, so I think we could afford to wait for the phase three results for assessment,\" he said.\n\nAnother member on the advisory panel - former Controller for the Centre for Health Protection, Thomas Tsang - said vaccines would be vetted in the same manner, regardless of where they were produced.\n\nHong Kong has already ordered and approved a vaccine by Germany's BioNTech. Authorities have also ordered the Oxford University vaccine by Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, which the CE said is expected to arrive in Hong Kong in the second half the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip, who is in charge of the government inoculation initiative, has said the vaccination programme can start once the BioNTech vaccine arrives some time in late February.\n\nNip said vaccination centres would be set up across the city and that they would operate daily for at least six months, between 8 am and 8 pm.",

Stories quite similar to what I have heard from our ICU doctors,\" team member Marion Koopmans tweeted.\n\nThe WHO-led probe has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.\n\nThe WHO, which has sought to manage expectations for the mission, said on Friday that team members would be limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and would not have any contact with community members, due to health restrictions.\n\nExactly a year ago, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), its highest level of alarm.\n\nThe group's itinerary has not been announced but the WHO has said the team plans to visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.\n\nLater on Saturday, the WHO team went to an exhibition centre that features an exhibit commemorating early efforts to battle the outbreak in Wuhan, which included a 76-day lockdown of the city of 11 million.\n\nThe investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former US President Donald Trump accused of being \"China-centric\".\n\nChina has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.\n\nChina's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a US army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.

Thousands more workers in other sites within the area were also advised to get tested for coronavirus.\n\nHe said the virus might have been spread in shared changing rooms, but he believed there is a low risk for workers of different companies at the sites to have contracted the disease from them.\n\n\"Contractors of different companies, their workers do not mix together. Because the island is a very very huge area and they are divided into different zones, in which different contractors work in different areas, so the possibility of mixing between the workers of different companies in the construction sites is very minimal,\" Au said.\n\nAltogether, authorities reported 28 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, all but two were locally acquired.\n\nSix cases did not have a clear source of infection.\n\nThis included a nurse who worked at the reception of an eye clinic in Champion Building in Jordan.\n\nAuthorities are calling on people who have visited Dr Lam Hok-suen between 26 and 29 January to get tested. The clinic will be closed for a fortnight.\n\nThe daily figure is the lowest in nearly a month, but Au said it's too early to decide whether this wave of outbreak has reached its peak, warning there's still risk of a resurgence if people attend gatherings over the coming Chinese new year.\n\nAu noted that in the past seven days, forty percent of the cases were of unknown sources, which showed that there are still a lot of silent transmissions in the community.\n\nThere are more than 40 preliminary positive cases.",

The city has seen an influx of tourists during its peak winter season as its heavily-indebted economy relies largely on tourism and entertainment.\n\nThe Gulf state of about 9 million people hopes massive vaccination will curb infections while keeping its economy open for business.\n\nOn Saturday, the government said 107,561 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were given in the past 24 hours, taking the total of doses distributed so far to 3,114,162, with a rate of of 31.49 doses per 100 people.

    "content": "China's factory activity grew at the slowest pace in five months in January, hit by a wave of domestic coronavirus infections, but still in line with the ongoing recovery in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nThe official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 in January from 51.9 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nIt remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, but was below the 51.6 expected in a Reuters poll of analyst forecasts.\n\nIn January, mainland China reported more than 2,000 local cases of the coronavirus. While the number was small compared with other countries, authorities were concerned about transmission risks during the Lunar New Year travel rush - the world's biggest annual human migration spanning 40 days from January to February.\n\nDuring the month several large cities were locked down with tens of millions tested for COVID-19, interrupting factory activity and weighing on the services sector, including logistics and transportation.\n\n\"The recent localised epidemic has had a certain impact on the production and operation of some enterprises, and the overall expansion of the manufacturing industry has slowed,\" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the statistics bureau.\n\n\"The period before and after the Lunar New Year is also traditionally an off-season for the country's manufacturing industry,\" Zhao said in an accompanying statement.\n\nThe new coronavirus outbreak, mostly in the north, is expected to be a temporary restraining factor while China's vast industrial sector continues to find strength in resilient export demand.\n\nThe official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.2, expanding for the fifth straight month, though down from 51.3 in December.\n\nEconomic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector.\n\nA sub-index for small firm activity stood at 49.4 in January, up from December's 48.8.\n\nChina's gross domestic product grew 2.3% on year in 2020, making it the only major economy in the world to dodge a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe central bank will extend the country's monetary policy support for economic growth with a focus on maximising employment to help boost consumption, Governor Yi Gang said last week.\n\nIn the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th straight month, the statistics bureau said, albeit at a slower clip, weighed by the latest COVID-19 outbreaks.

    "content": "Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung warned on Sunday that more coronavirus lockdowns may be coming soon despite a mixed response to three such exercises since Saturday last week.\n\nWriting in his blog, Cheung said the government’s goal remains reducing the number of Covid-19 cases to zero, and different types of operations to impose mandatory tests on at-risk residents could be launched on different scales within the short term.\n\nHe said government departments had been told to get ready to quickly deploy civil servants to join frontline anti-epidemic work at short notice.\n\nSome experts have said the limited lockdowns the government has imposed in Jordan, Yau Ma Tei and North Point haven’t been very effective, given that of almost 8,000 tests conducted, just 14 Covid infections were found.\n\nBut Cheung insisted such programmes have been useful.\n\n“This kind of targeted and effective action successfully identified silent patients quickly while minimising the impact on people. The government will continue to boost the scale and speed of this kind of action based on the development of the pandemic and practical needs,” he said.\n\n“Silent virus carriers often don’t have any symptoms and they are spreading the virus unknowingly. The government will not underestimate a single source of infection as any of them might cause a large-scale outbreak.”\n\nThe Chief Secretary added that officials will carry on enforcing mandatory test orders even after lockdowns are lifted, saying they will root out those who had not gotten tested as required.\n\nCheung said around 30 people had been fined HK$5,000 for failing to take the mandatory tests in the past week.\n\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said in her blog that the authorities would take more resolute and strict action to control the Covid outbreak.\n\nShe noted that businesses had been hit hard by the pandemic but stressed that a “short period of inconvenience” could completely cut off virus transmission in the community, which would then allow commercial activities to resume.",

    "content": "A pharmacists' group said on Sunday that the government should be publishing more information, in layman's terms, about the efficacy and safety of coronavirus vaccines, after a survey they conducted suggested that less than a third of people intend to get inoculated.\n\nThe Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong survey found that 36 percent of the 838 people it questioned had not yet decided whether to get vaccinated, while 33 percent said they would not join a vaccination programme.\n\nYounger people were more likely to say they would not be inoculated, and just 16 percent of female respondents said they would definitely take part in a vaccination programme.\n\n\"It is a concern,\" said the society's president, Dr William Chui. \"The main reason is because they're afraid of the side effect and also the adverse drug reaction of the vaccine.\"\n\nOf those who said they would not be vaccinated, 84 percent cited concerns about side effects and safety and 83 percent had doubts about the efficacy of \"rushed\" vaccines. Sixty-two percent said they would not consider getting vaccinated until the mass vaccination results from other countries confirmed that the jabs had no adverse side effects.\n\n\"We think the Hong Kong government can provide more information about the vaccine,\" Chui said. \"The more accurate and more timely information is the key to success.\"\n\nHe said it was also critical for the government to translate the available clinical data into layman's terms. He suggested pharmacists, who are familiar with dealing with the public on a day-to-day basis, could help translate the data so it's easier for people to understand.\n\nThe society also asked people which of the three government-procured vaccines they would get. given the choice. Thirty-five percent either hadn’t decided, didn’t know or found it difficult to say, but 65 percent had made up their minds.\n\nThe vaccine from BioNTech was the most popular, with 60 percent. It was followed by the Sinovac vaccine, with 18 percent, and then the AstraZeneca vaccine with 15 percent.\n\nThe society said 458 people were asked about their preference between January 8 and 12, while 138 were asked between January 13 and 17 – after Brazil published clinical data showing the Sinovac vaccine had an efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.\n\nIntent to take the Sinovac vaccine saw a sharp drop, but was still higher than the AstraZeneca jab.\n\nChui suggested this might be because the Sinovac vaccine relied on more familiar methods.\n\n\"The technology platform is actually an inactivate vaccine,\" he said. \"People know that the inactivate technology is mature and like the influenza vaccine – they're using the same technology – so that's why, especially the elderly or the health-care professionals, they prefer to use the SInovac vaccine.",

    "content": "A University of Hong Kong professor on Sunday urged the government to explore the possibility of replacing one mainland vaccine with another if it means the territory can launch its universal Covid-19 vaccination scheme earlier.\n\nProfessor Lo Chung-mau, the chief executive of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital across the border, said it’s fair game at this stage to replace Sinovac with Sinopharm vaccines, given the former company has yet to produce enough data from clinical trials to allow local authorities to approve their product for emergency use.\n\nHong Kong had secured 7.5 million coronavirus jabs from Sinovac, with the first shipments originally scheduled to arrive by now, but the process has been delayed indefinitely given a lack of data.\n\nSpeaking on a television programme, Lo proposed that the government should change tack and proactively approach Sinopharm for more information.\n\nIts vaccines have been approved for use in the mainland, and authorities there plan to inoculate millions of people with its product.\n\nMainland authorities had green-lighted the Sinopharm jab based on Phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 79 percent.\n\nHowever, that figure is based only on an interim analysis, and the state-owned firm has yet to release the full data from the trials.\n\nNonetheless, Professor Lo said preliminary efficacy rate is enough to warrant a closer look by the SAR government.\n\n“It’s far more than enough in terms of efficacy. It’s a well-established technology. There are fewer side effects than that caused by the Pfizer vaccines,” he said.\n\n“We should not just sit in Hong Kong and wait for the drug companies to approach us. We should actively look for vaccines for the sake of Hong Kong people’s health.”\n\nHe said more than 3,500 staff at his Shenzhen hospital received Sinopharm jabs last month, with only 20 developing mild side effects, such as infection-site pain, rashes and a runny nose, and none requiring treatment.\n\nLo stressed that the government’s top priority should be controlling the pandemic quickly, rather than honouring its promise with a drug-maker.\n\nHong Kong’s sole representative on the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, Tam Yiu-chung, had previously also called for the use of Sinopharm jabs here, saying he had personally gotten inoculated across the border and reported being able to sleep better afterwards.\n\nThe calls to explore the use of the Sinopharm vaccine comes as concerns grow over whether shipments of the BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines to Hong Kong could be delayed after the European Union imposed export controls for the jabs.\n\nHong Kong is expecting to start its vaccination programme late next month with jabs from the German manufacturer BioNTech. So far, it is the only vaccine with final approval for use here.\n\nThe government has said it is continuing to negotiate purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers from around the world, and the mainland to obtain more vaccines which meet the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality.\n\nHealth minister Sophia Chan stressed that the government has been proactive in trying to obtain trial data.",

Both – it said, are fundamental pillars of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle.\n\nOn a more concrete note, DAB chair Starry Lee said the administration is in grave need of reform to cut red tape, enhance efficiency, and make the government more flexible and responsive.\n\n\"We have been fighting the coronavirus for over one year. Still, we can see there's a lack of strong co-ordination [within government],” Lee said.\n\n“I think that's not something about a person – it's the overall system that we want to look at in order to improve.”\n\nLee said besides the introduction of the accountability system for politically appointed officials brought in almost 20 years ago, there have been no major changes to the government structure since the handover.\n\nOne idea is to link the performance of civil servants to the success of their policies.\n\n\"We would like to make civil servants more responsible for the policies and for building a better society,” Lee said.\n\nDAB vice chairman, Holden Chow, meanwhile, again urged Hong Kong to follow the UK in introducing a Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, to improve the complaint mechanism against judges.\n\nThe party said there should also be reforms to the government’s social welfare system citing the large wealth gap in the SAR.\n\nThe party says it will reach out to people to seek concrete ideas for reform – both through the internet and by mobilising its community volunteers.",

    "content": "The government on Sunday announced its third “ambush-style” lockdown in less than a week, requiring all residents of two blocks of Laguna City in Lam Tin to take a Covid-19 test.\n\nResidents of Blocks 5 and 7 will need to take the coronavirus test by 2am on Monday morning, and officials hope they can complete the entire operation by 7am on Monday.\n\nThe government said that there had been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the two blocks over the past fortnight.\n\nIt said it understands that around 1,200 residents had already been tested recently, but it wants another round done to \"completely cut off transmission chains\".\n\nThose who had done a test this past Friday to Sunday do not have to get tested again, it said, if they can provide proof that they tested negative.\n\nBut residents will still need to wait at home until everyone else in the blocks has been tested.\n\nOne resident wasn't too happy about the lockdown.\n\n\"I find this to be a bit annoying, there's not much I can do. Why? I just got tested a couple days ago, and it's negative. I don't know why I have to get tested again so quickly,\" he told reporters, adding that some visitors to the blocks should have to stay for the night and get tested.\n\nAnother domestic helper said she's doing her third test in recent days, but she's fine with it because it's for the safety of everybody.\n\nChief Secretary Matthew Cheung had earlier on Sunday said that more lockdowns would be coming soon, despite the mixed response to such exercises.\n\nHe said the government’s goal was to reduce the number of Covid-19 cases to zero, and government departments had been told to get ready to deploy quickly and at short notice.\n\nHealth chief Sophia Chan also defended the lockdowns, saying a “short period of inconvenience” could completely cut off transmissions in the community and allow commercial activities to resume.\n\nSome medical experts have questioned the effectiveness of such lockdowns however, with the sealing off of areas in Yau Ma Tei and North Point uncovering just 14 Covid-19 infections from the 8,000 tests that were conducted.",

Government workers on site were still carrying out what was described as a law enforcement operation to find people who hadn't taken a test.\n\nOfficials said they had tested 460 people at eight testing stations as of 2am without finding any new cases. They visited 394 homes, getting no answer at 60 of them, some of which may have been vacant or home to people who had already tested positive or been sent to quarantine.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration condemned an attack on a government worker taking part in the testing exercise inside the restricted area. It sent condolences to the injured colleague and said people under mandatory testing should cooperate.\n\nLaguna City emerged as an area of concern last week, with officials ordering a partial evacuation of Block 5 after 10 residents and two staff were diagnosed with the virus. Flat E on each floor was evacuated after people on several floors fell ill, which experts said indicated vertical transmission.\n\nIn total, 15 cases were found in the two blocks last week.\n\nThe government held the first of what Chief Executive Carrie Lam called \"ambush-style\" lockdowns in Yau Ma Tei on Tuesday, finding one case. A lockdown in North Point on Thursday found no cases.",

That means that area is zero infection….so the people living there, going to shop there, they feel comfortable, they feel safe and assured,” he said.\n\nCheung also said that in addition to the current practice of sending all close contacts of Covid patients into quarantine, people who live with close contacts will be ordered to take a test for the virus.\n\nThe chief secretary noted that a lot of businesses are facing big challenges and the jobless rate is growing.\n\nBut he cited medical experts as saying Hong Kong needs more time to see improvements in its coronavirus situation, and said therefore the current social distancing rules will be extended until February 17.\n\nThe Education Secretary, Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said officials will meet school representatives and decide this week how schools can resume face-to-face classes in a gradual and flexible manner after the Chinese New Year holiday.\n\nYeung said teachers would be encouraged to get tested for Covid regularly.\n\n\"As he or she has to face a number of students each day in a school setting, it would be very much better if all the teaching staff as well as all the other colleagues in a school have done certain type of tests on a regular basis.

    "content": "An investigation panel appointed by the MTR Corporation says the railway company underestimated glitches in a new signalling system which eventually led to the delay of a major upgrade.\n\nThe probe showed the corporation first learned about the issue in May last year, but did not resolve it until September. The problem forced the rail operator to postpone the launch of a new signalling system originally scheduled to go online the next day.\n\nThe panel concluded that if the MTR had carried out a more detailed investigation earlier, it would have realised how complex the issue was and might have been able to report this to its management and the government and avoid the delay.\n\nBut the probe cleared the railway company of allegations that it had covered up the glitches which prevented the system from being introduced to the East Rail Line and the future Shatin-Central Link.\n\nDuring a press conference on Monday, the MTR’s CEO Jacob Kam said the problems have now been fixed, and the system will be put into operation on Saturday.\n\nKam admitted that the rail company's engineers should have been more sensitive – but stressed that train safety was still guaranteed.\n\n\"The report has pointed out that the working team had underestimated the complexity of the issue, and also there was of course a lack of sensitivity to the public expectation of service quality,\" he explained.\n\n\"These combined underestimation had caused them to miss the best time to conduct detailed analysis of the problem, and miss the good opportunity to reporting both internally and externally about the issue and follow up.\"\n\nHe said a new dedicated team directly accountable to him will be set up to monitor the construction of the Shatin-Central link.\n\nBut he conceded the delay will have an impact on the opening of the cross-harbour section next year, and said the company will make announcements once it has an idea when the new line could open.\n\nThe government – which is the MTR's largest shareholder – issued a statement following the report, saying it reserves the rights to pursue liability.\n\n“The government expresses grave disappointment that the incident has led to the postponement of the commissioning of the EAL [East Rail line] new signalling system and mixed-fleet operation, and possible deferral of the commissioning of the cross harbour section of the EAL, and reserves the right to take further actions against [MTR Corp],” said the statement.",

And all of that detailed analysis leads to more and more questions,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on Covid-19, told a Geneva news conference on Monday evening.\n\n\"Their focus is on the early cases they are having very good discussions around that.\"\n\nMike Ryan, WHO's top emergency official, said: \"We continue to ask the questions, we continue to push for more data ... It's a detective story and you go through again and you answer more questions.\"\n\nNo full itinerary for the group's field work has been announced, and journalists covering the tightly controlled visit have been kept at a distance from team members.\n\nYanzhong Huang, senior fellow with the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, said two weeks in the field was not much time for the experts.\n\n\"I don't think they have the time to get any conclusive results. It is more like communication and information exchange,\" Huang said by phone from Washington.\n\n\"It depends how diligent they are in digging new information but also about how cooperative and accommodating the Chinese side will be.\"\n\nBeijing has sought to cast doubt on the notion that the coronavirus originated in China, pointing to imported frozen food as a conduit.\n\nThat hypothesis figured again on Sunday in the Global Times tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.\n\nOn Sunday, the experts visited the Huanan seafood market linked to initial infections, and the Baishazhou wholesale food market, where a loudspeaker repeatedly announced that the sale of imported cold chain products was banned at the market.(Reuters)",

But, probably, the government leaders don't see this situation.\"\n\nWong said some 3,000 restaurants were now on the verge of being forced to close.\n\nThe government said on Monday that almost all social distancing regulations would be extended until February 17, the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, meaning restaurants will have to close early throughout the holiday.\n\nOfficials said they were launching 10 days of aggressive action to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the hope of easing restrictions on businesses and gradually reopening schools afterwards.",

But having gone through these tests, at least the residents are much more assured that they are not living in a highly infectious area.”\n\nLam added that authorities will continue to impose the lockdowns in a targeted manner, with about 1,000 residents to be confined to their homes and tested at any one time.\n\nShe said officials strive to carry out the tests quickly and limit the lockdowns to between 7pm and 7am the next day, so that people’s daily lives are not seriously affected.\n\n“I hope residents will appreciate that we are already considerably reducing the impact on them. But as I said, this is a matter of joint efforts. It’s not just the government, but the community at large has to join hands in order to contain the spread of the virus.”",

    "content": "Infectious disease experts are urging the government to lock down construction sites for mass coronavirus tests if there are any outbreaks.\n\nSpeaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Tuesday, Dr Joseph Tsang with the Medical Association said construction sites are prone to spreading the coronavirus, and the government will not be able to cut the chains of transmission early if it just cordons off residential buildings for testing, because workers may have already brought the virus into the community.\n\nHe also said the government should consider conducting compulsory testing at all construction sites.\n\nHis view was echoed by another expert, Ho Pak-leung, who heads the University of Hong Kong's Centre for Infection.\n\n\"The government can seal off construction sites and test the workers exposed to the virus in 12 hours during daytime. I think it's more effective in intercepting the virus before they are spread into buildings in the community,\" he told an RTHK programme.\n\nHo believed that the Covid outbreaks at two tunnel construction sites led to a rebound of cases in January, as some of the workers live in densely populated districts such as Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po.\n\nThe expert also said he believed some of the lockdown exercises overnight were related to an outbreak at the airport's third runway construction sites or buildings with cases that were untraceable.\n\n\"If they focus on high-risk buildings... and impose an lockdown in these neighbourhoods, I think this strategy is more practical,\" Ho said, adding the government doesn't have the manpower to seal off dozens of buildings every day.\n\nHo also said if the community lockdowns were to be effective, residents should be given a second test five days later, to uncover cases that were in the incubation period.",

    "content": "Japan's government approved a month-long extension of its coronavirus state of emergency on Tuesday, less than six months before the pandemic-postponed Olympic Games open in Tokyo.\n\n\"We have decided to extend the state of emergency until March 7th,\" Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a meeting of the taskforce guiding the government's pandemic policy.\n\nThe extension will apply to 10 of the 11 areas currently under the measure, including greater Tokyo, which had been due to end on February 7.\n\nIt will not be extended in Tochigi, north of the capital, where cases are judged to have dropped sufficiently.\n\n\"In prefectures where the virus situation improves, we will gradually lift the state of emergency, without having to wait for March 7th,\" Suga added.\n\nThe extension had been widely expected, with government spokesman Katsunobu Kato telling reporters on Tuesday morning that \"it is our understanding that continued vigilance is warranted for a while\".\n\nJapan's virus emergency is significantly looser than the lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world, and primarily calls for increased teleworking and the closure of bars and restaurants from 8pm.\n\nLegislation currently working its way through parliament would add enforcement measures, including fines for businesses that do not close early.\n\nBut even the comparatively relaxed approach appears to have yielded results, with new infections dropping across the country.\n\nStill, after facing criticism for its initial reluctance to impose the measure, the government has been cautious about lifting it too quickly.\n\n\"Since the declaration of the state of emergency last month, the number of coronavirus patients in Japan is declining and we can say this measure focusing on shorter hours at restaurants has clearly been effective,\" Suga said.\n\n\"We need to continue with this downward trend and decrease the number of hospitalised patients and patients in serious condition.\"\n\nSuga's government resisted calls for the emergency late last year, despite an uptick in cases in December, worried about the impact on an economy that only just exited recession.\n\nThe measure initially covered just the greater Tokyo area, but was expanded about a week after it was first announced as infections spiked in several parts of the country.\n\nJapan's coronavirus outbreak has been comparatively small nationwide, with around 5,800 deaths overall.\n\nBut the country's healthcare system has become increasingly overburdened, and public support for both the initial imposition of the emergency, and Tuesday's extension, is strong.\n\nSuga's government has seen approval ratings plummet over its handling of the country's third wave of infections, which has increased doubts about the prospects for this summer's postponed Olympics.\n\nJapan's government, organisers and Olympic officials all insist the Games will go ahead this summer, and extensive virus countermeasures are being developed to keep the event safe.\n\nBut public opinion remains opposed, with around 80 percent of Japanese polled backing a further postponement or outright cancellation.\n\nJapan has tightened border restrictions during the state of emergency, ending exemptions for athletes.\n\nThat has forced the cancellation and postponement of some sports events, including the first Olympic test event of 2021 – an artistic swimming qualifier that had been scheduled for March.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori said the Games would go ahead \"however the coronavirus (pandemic) evolves.\"\n\n\"We must go beyond discussion about whether we will hold it or not. It's about how we will do it. Let's think about a new kind of Olympics on this occasion,\" he added at a meeting of Olympic organisers and members of the Suga's ruling party. (AFP)",

    "content": "Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is 91.6 percent effective against symptomatic Covid-19, according to results published in The Lancet on Tuesday that independent experts said allayed transparency concerns over the jab, which Moscow is already rolling out.\n\nSputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- was approved in Russia months before results from its final-stage clinical trials were published, leading to scepticism from experts.\n\nBut the new analysis of data from 20,000 participants in Phase 3 trials suggests that the two-dose vaccination offers more than 90 percent efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19.\n\n\"The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency,\" said an independent Lancet commentary by Ian Jones of the University of Reading and Polly Roy of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19.\"\n\nThe results suggest Sputnik V is among the top performing vaccines, along with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs that also reported more than 90 percent efficacy.\n\nPre-empting the results of the phase 3 trials, Russia has already launched a mass inoculation campaign for citizens 18 and older.\n\nSeveral countries around the world have already registered Sputnik V, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund which helped develop the vaccine, including Belarus, Venezuela, Bolivia and Algeria.\n\nIn January, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany had offered Russia support in Moscow's development of Sputnik V, after Russian authorities said they had applied for registration in the European Union.\n\nThe trial involved giving 14,964 participants in the vaccine group and 4,902 in the placebo group two jabs 21 days apart.\n\nThose taking part were tested for Covid-19 at enrolment into the trial, again when they had the second dose and then after that if they reported symptoms.\n\nFrom the second dose, 16 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 were confirmed in the vaccine group and 62 cases were reported in the placebo group, giving an efficacy equivalent to 91.6 percent.\n\nThe authors said, however, that efficacy was only calculated on symptomatic cases and said more research would be needed to assess how it affects asymptomatic disease.\n\nThey added that the follow-up period was around 48 days from the first dose, so the full period of protection is still unknown. The trial is ongoing and plans to recruit a total of 40,000 people.\n\nSputnik V uses two different disarmed strains of the adenovirus, a virus that causes the common cold, as vectors to deliver the vaccine dose.\n\nDevelopers said that using a different adenovirus vector for the booster vaccination minimises the risk of the immune system developing resistance to the initial vector, so it may help create a more powerful response.\n\nAlexander Edwards, an Associate Professor in Biomedical Technology at the University of Reading, said the trial might help provide evidence to this theory of immune response.\n\n\"Pandemic means 'all' -- and the only way to address a global problem is with a global response -- sharing data, science, technology and medicines,\" he said.\n\nThe vaccine has the advantage of being able to be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures instead of the conditions far below freezing required for some other vaccines.

    "content": "Singapore's parliament passed a law on Tuesday limiting the use of data collected for coronavirus contact-tracing after the government admitted it could be accessed by police, sparking privacy concerns.\n\nThe city-state last year rolled out a programme called \"TraceTogether\" for tracking close contacts of Covid-19 patients that works via both a phone app and dongle, but uptake was initially slow.\n\nIt rose to more than 80 percent of residents after government assurances the data would only be used to fight the virus and a decision to make it mandatory for accessing some public places.\n\nBut there was an outcry last month when officials admitted police could access information gathered in the scheme as part of investigations, and had already done so during a murder probe.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers approved legislation limiting the cases in which police can get hold of the data.\n\nIt did not cut them off entirely but will give them access only during investigations into seven categories of serious offence, including possession of firearms, terrorism and rape.\n\nBefore the legislation was passed, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan acknowledged in parliament it was a mistake for the government not to have made it clear early on that police would have access.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for this mistake and I deeply regret the consternation, the anxiety that was caused by my mistake,\" said Balakrishnan, who has overseen the scheme.\n\nThe government's admission that police could access the data sparked a furious backlash, with many in the tightly regulated city saying they felt betrayed and activists accusing authorities of undermining the right to privacy.\n\nSingapore has only suffered a mild outbreak, with nearly 60,000 cases and 29 deaths.\n\nMany countries have rolled out contact-tracing programmes that work via smartphone apps, but uptake has been low in some due largely to privacy concerns.

    "info": "We begin the show by venturing to the great outdoors and to the world of landscape photography. Given that Hong Kong is known as one of the world’s most densely populated cities, its relatively unspoilt landscapes are often and easily overlooked and underestimated. For many, it might not seem the most likely place of origin for an award-winning landscape photographer. Of course, we have all stopped to take the occasional landscape photograph, even if only on our phones. But good landscape photography demands more than that. For the dedicated photographer, like Kelvin Yuen, it also takes considerable effort to find the right light, time, vantage point and subject to capture that unforgettable moment.  From landscape photography we are turning to street photography, or at least urban photography. We have been battling the Covid-19 pandemic for a year now. Wearing masks has become part of our daily lives. That has not always gone down well with photographers who like to photograph people on the streets. Photographer Birdy Chu and some of his students at the Department of Media and Communication at the City University of Hong Kong have taken our new normal as their subject, as they show us in the exhibition “Masked Life” at the Goethe-Institut Gallery.     The Giocoso Trio was formed in 2018 by three friends who were studying in Britain’s Royal College of Music. They say the Italian word “giocoso”, which means lively and humorous, is often used as a direction in music, and best describes the kind of music they want to create with the flute, clarinet and piano.",

Why can't you show understanding to low-income earners? Please show some sympathy,\" he said.\n\nAnother caller, surnamed Tsang, said the government was to blame for the state of the economy, saying it had handled the pandemic poorly.\n\n\"My income is also affected. But [officials] are still getting paid hundreds of thousands dollars a month. One even said she can't deposit money at banks and has to put the money at home. Why is she showing off?\" she complained, apparently referring to Chief Executive Carrie Lam's claim that she stores her salary at home, in cash.\n\nSpeaking on the same programme, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, Lam Chun-sing, said the freeze means grassroots workers can't maintain their purchasing power, and this would affect their living standard.\n\nBut the convenor of the Hong Kong Business Community Joint Conference, Catherine Yan, said even if the minimum wage were to be increased, businesses would just shift the cost to consumers, and make people's lives even harder.",

What protection can it offer?\" she asked.\n\nShe said the government should instead take action to improve environmental hygiene in the district.\n\nAnother resident of the district grumbled, “It's unacceptable that the test results came so late. I'm late for work!” as he scrambled to find a taxi.\n\nOther affected people were more understanding.\n\nA newspaper hawker who gave her surname as Wong, meanwhile, said she couldn’t set up her stall at 6.30am as usual because of the lockdown. She expects to lose a third of her earnings as a result.\n\nBut she said she had no complaints as the tests could put peoples' minds at ease.\n\nIn Jordan, an elderly man was forced to sleep over in his friend's home as the lockdown was imposed when they were having dinner.\n\nHe was fine with the arrangements.\n\n\"The testing staff came to my friend's home and collected our specimens because we're all elderly and one of us is in a wheelchair. They also brought us some food. It's really considerate,\" he said.",

    "content": "A secondary school principal on Thursday questioned the government's proposal to resume in-person classes after the Chinese New Year break once all teachers and staff return negative Covid-19 test results.\n\nTai Tak-ching, the headmaster of Sheng Kung Hui Tang Shiu Kin Secondary School, told an RTHK programme that both the government and health experts don't consider the wider community to be necessarily safe after the holiday.\n\nThe head of the Wan Chai District Headmasters' Conference also said even if teachers test negative for Covid-19, school campuses would not be safe because the disease has a long incubation period.\n\n\"It's just an illusion that you are safe [after testing], which may lead to people letting their guard down,\" Tai said, adding that he will discuss the government plan with his teachers.\n\nSecretary for Education Kevin Yeung defended the plan, saying school staff have a bigger responsibility than students to get tested because they're providing a service.\n\n\"Teachers as the educator as well as the carer of students, they have to look at the interests of the student. And so, if they are willing, we appreciate very much that they are willing to do the test to offer more protection to the students,\" he said.\n\nYeung insisted the testing arrangement is optional, and said he doesn't hope schools would feel the pressure to force their teachers to undergo tests. Still, he said it's better to get tested to help prevent the spread of the virus.",

    "content": "The Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the government will introduce a series of new laws to tackle privacy infringements, hate speech and fake news.\n\nAt a Legco question-and-answer session on Thursday, Lam said such problems have proliferated on the internet over the past two years when Hong Kong was in the midst of anti-government protests and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShe said these issues must be tackled carefully, adding that her administration will table legislative proposals after considering what other jurisdictions are doing.\n\nOne important area that needs to be looked at, Lam said, is how to better regulate public record searches in the SAR.\n\nShe said the current mechanism is prone to abuse and facilitate doxxing activities, and the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau is soon expected to table proposed legislative amendments to Legco to enhance personal data protection.\n\n“The main idea [of data searches] is to provide convenience to the public and service users for specific purposes, such as property, vehicle and company transactions. Given the high level of concern shown by the society on protecting personal data privacy and given the acts of doxxing in recent years in which personal data has been obtained through inspection of registers, different government departments are currently reviewing the legal requirements and administrative arrangements,” she said.\n\nIn response, the chairman of the Journalists Association, Chris Yeung, called on the government to make clear that reporters' work would not be affected by the potential changes.\n\nHe accused the government of using doxxing as an excuse to curb press freedom.\n\n\"Carrie Lam has not categorically differentiated doxxing from, say, journalists' right to conduct searches for reporting purposes. They are two issues that should not be mixed up. It seems to us that doxxing has been used as an excuse to put restrictions on journalists and by doing so, putting curbs on press freedom and people's right to know,\" he said.\n\nFormer RTHK producer Bao Choy was arrested in November last year for allegedly breaching the Road Traffic Ordinance while conducting car licence plate searches for a documentary on the July 21 Yuen Long attacks.\n\nThe Transport Department has since launched a new service, which alerts people if their cars have been subject to a licence plate search.",

    "content": "The Consumer Council said it received more than 30,000 complaints last year – 26 percent more than the previous year and the highest since 2015 – due to a surge in travel- and health-related cases amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe watchdog said more than 5,300 out of the 30,395 complaints were related to travel matters, the highest among all product categories and more than double the figure in 2019.\n\nThis was followed by about 4,700 complaints related to medical or health products, most of them involving purchases of face masks.\n\nPaul Lam, the council’s chairman, said the rise in the overall number of complaints was mainly due to the pandemic.\n\n\"I think the most prominent example is the increase in the number of complaints concerning face masks. In 2019, we received about seven complaints only. But last year, we received a total of 4,486 complaints. So that already accounted for an increase of more than 4,000 complaints last year.”\n\nLam explained that people went on a buying spree of face masks when supplies were scarce in the early days of the pandemic. He said many traders were overwhelmed by the purchase orders and failed to deliver their products on time.\n\nOn those travel-related complaints, more than 80 percent involved disputes over the purchase of flight tickets from travel agencies, airlines or online platforms.\n\nThe council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, said instead of getting a refund for cancelled flights, many customers were given travel credit as compensation.\n\nShe said the watchdog will closely monitor whether the rights of these customers are protected.\n\n“This is another area that looking forward we have to be very cautious, mainly because for those credits, how airlines are going to fulfil their promise to allow the consumers to use the credit to buy tickets, whether the airfare will be more expensive than before or it will take a much longer time to book the tickets etc…that is something we have to monitor in future when the pandemic gets more settled and people start to travel again,” she said.\n\nThe council also said online shopping accounted for more than 40 percent of the complaints last year.\n\nWith the practice becoming increasingly popular during the pandemic, Wong said the watchdog will continue to conduct \"mystery shopping\" and publish its findings on the quality of online traders in hopes of improving their services.",

    "date": "2021-02-04 HKT 18:24",
    "content": "The government has proposed a series of measures to help people who can't find enough work during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLabour secretary Law Chi-kwong said on Thursday that the government is seeking to relax the criteria for a basic subsidy for low-income families, to allow around 24,000 more underemployed households to benefit from the scheme for a year.\n\nHe said eligible non-single parent families could apply for a monthly subsidy under the Working Family Allowance Scheme if they work at least 72 hours a month, instead of the original 144 hours.\n\n“These days a lot of people cannot work full-time and have to take no-paid leave. In these circumstances, a lot of families or individuals, because of this situation, apart from reducing income, may lose the eligibility to apply for the Working Family Allowance,” Law said.\n\nThe minister said the government will also relax the requirements for struggling households to receive food supplies.\n\nA four-person family with assets totalling less than HK$548,000 will be eligible for the Short-term Food Assistance Service, up from the current limit of HK$264,000; while the assets cap for a single person to be eligible will be raised from HK$99,000 to HK$266,000.\n\nBoth relief measures are expected to be rolled out on June 1 and will be effective for one year, after the Legislative Council's finance committee approves the plans.\n\nHowever, Law said the government will scrap a transport subsidy for low-income working individuals, so that more resources could be used to help underemployed families eligible for the adjusted Working Family Allowance Scheme.\n\nLaw said he believed only a small number of transport subsidy recipients will be affected by the change, because most of them will be able to switch to the Working Family Allowance Scheme.\n\nLaw said, for example, an eligible four-person family could get a HK$3,800 subsidy under the Working Family Allowance Scheme if between them they worked more than 72 hours a month. He said this figure would be higher than what they could get if all four applied for the transport subsidy – which would add up to a total of HK$2,400 per month.\n\nMeanwhile, the secretary again rejected calls for a fund to support the unemployed.\n\n“In this whole world, no country, no government has ever provided non-means tested, or non-contributive unemployment benefits. And it’s very interesting that people in Hong Kong have been advocating for such a scheme that no one else in this world would do,” he said.\n\nLaw said it’s neither meaningful nor practical to set up a temporary unemployment fund, arguing that it would be difficult for the government to justify helping those who became jobless before a certain cut-off date, but not those after it – as the two groups of people would both deserve help.\n\nHe added that it would also be equally difficult to stop providing temporary unemployment subsidies once the city’s unemployment rate dropped to a certain level.\n\n“It’ll be very difficult, in policy terms, that we should support the ones who are unemployed at four percent unemployment rate, but not the ones who are unemployed at an unemployment rate of 3.99. Because they’re actually in the same situation.”",

Those efforts have now been exhausted,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Following careful consideration, taking account of all the facts and the broadcaster’s and audience’s rights to freedom of expression, we have decided it is appropriate to revoke the licence for CGTN to broadcast in the UK.\"\n\nOfcom said revoking CGTN's licence would not affect sanctions proceedings against the station for \"failing to preserve due impartiality in its coverage of the Hong Kong protests\", as well as a \"serious breach\" of its fairness and privacy rules.\n\nIt said a decision on this is expected to be reached shortly, adding that it has three other investigations underway regarding the content of CGTN's services.\n\nLast July, Ofcom warned CGTN that it faced sanctions over a forced confession it broadcast involving British citizen Peter Humphrey.\n\nSimon Cheng, a former worker at the UK consulate in Hong Kong, also filed a complaint to the regulator over a confession he said he was forced to make after being tortured while in detention on the mainland.\n\nShortly after the British regulator announced the revocation of CGTN's licence, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had lodged \"stern representations\" to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) over what it said was \"fake news\" coverage of Covid-19, and urged the broadcaster to publicly apologise.\n\nIn a statement, a ministry spokesperson said that the BBC had recently \"linked the pandemic to politics\" and \"rehashed theories about covering up by China\".

    "content": "Health officials said on Friday that the suspected coronavirus case the authorities found during their latest ambush lockdowns turned out to be a recovered Covid patient.\n\nThursday night saw buildings in Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok sealed off as tests were carried out on more than 2,100 residents, and the government said one person tested preliminary positive for the virus.\n\nDr Chuang Shuk-kwan of the Centre for Health Protection said this person was actually a recovered patient who was discharged from hospital last Sunday and therefore isn't a new case after all.\n\nAsked if people who have recovered from the infection should be exempted from testing, Chuang said it might be difficult in practice as they would have to provide proof to officials that they were previously confirmed cases.\n\n“It is well known that patients may excrete virus for some time despite it may not be infectious,” she said.\n\n“As for whether [there should be an] exemption for these cases, we have not discussed this because for the lockdown operation it’s usually a mass lockdown. We may consider that but provided the patient can produce evidence, so sometimes it may be difficult because they won’t bring all these documents around to show that he’s a previously confirmed case.”\n\nThe authorities reported 37 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, 34 of which were locally acquired.\n\nOfficials were unable to trace the source of nine infections, including a business traveller who crossed the border from Shenzhen on January 23 and was exempted from quarantine.\n\nChuang said officials decided to classify the patient as having contracted the virus in Hong Kong, rather than Shenzhen.\n\n“It’s just a temporary classification because we want to prevent further spread so we’ll consider this as a local case management. The investigation of any epidemiological link to Shenzhen or local will continue. So we won’t put a case as imported [until] we have sufficient evidence,” she said.\n\n“As Shenzhen has zero local cases at the moment, the risk is not high.”\n\nMeanwhile, some 20 staff who work at an engineering company in Tuen Mun were being put under quarantine, after two workers there came down with Covid-19. One of the pair flew to South Korea last week and was confirmed with the infection there.\n\nMore than 20 other people also tested preliminary positive for the virus.",

    "content": "A private estate in Yuen Long and a public housing block in Ma On Shan were put on lockdown on Friday evening, the latest residential buildings to be sealed off in the government's ambush-style operations aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe lockdown order for both blocks of Fu Loy Garden on Ma Wang Road in Yuen Long took effect at 7pm.\n\nResidents inside the restricted zone will have to get tested by 2am unless they've already done so between Wednesday and Friday and have proof that they're virus-free.\n\nIn Ma On Shan, Heng Kong House in Heng On Estate was sealed off from 7:35pm. Residents who tested negative from Tuesday to Friday won't have to be tested again.\n\nOfficials expect to complete both operations on 7am on Saturday morning.\n\nOne person tested preliminary positive for Covid-19 during the previous round of ambush-style lockdowns in Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei.\n\nHe's a recovered patient who left hospital less than a week ago.\n\nHong Kong on Friday reported 37 new coronavirus cases, nine of which could not be traced.",

    "content": "The government has decided to exempt mainland drugmaker Sinovac from having to publish data from late-stage clinical trials in a medical journal, before a panel of experts decides whether to recommend its coronavirus vaccine for use here, after the firm said it was facing difficulties collating such information for publication.\n\nSinovac was supposed to have already delivered a million doses of coronavirus vaccines to Hong Kong by the end of January, but authorities have been unable to approve the jabs because the firm had not supplied the necessary data.\n\nIt was originally supposed to be the first vaccine to arrive for the government’s planned universal vaccine programme.\n\nA statement issued by the Food and Health Bureau on Friday said given the urgency of the situation, it has agreed that Sinovac will instead send data from its Phase III clinical trials in Brazil that it has already submitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO), to the expert panel here.\n\nThis bypasses the requirement for the information to be published in a medical journal, which a spokesman said would have guaranteed a higher level of recognition.\n\nIt is not clear whether the information to be provided is any different to that which would have been published in reputable journals.\n\nThe spokesman said Sinovac could provide such data by the end of the week, and authorities can collate the information and forward it to the panel for consideration next week.\n\nHe stressed that the government will ensure that any vaccine approved for use would meet safety, efficacy and quality requirements before they are given to the public.\n\nSo far, authorities have only approved a German vaccine produced by BioNTech. The first shipments are due to arrive by late February.",
