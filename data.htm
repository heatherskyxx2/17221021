            <td>We begin the show by venturing to the great outdoors and to the world of landscape photography. Given
                that Hong Kong is known as one of the worldâs most densely populated cities, its relatively unspoilt
                landscapes are often and easily overlooked and underestimated. For many, it might not seem the most
                likely place of origin for an award-winning landscape photographer. Of course, we have all stopped to
                take the occasional landscape photograph, even if only on our phones. But good landscape photography
                demands more than that. For the dedicated photographer, like Kelvin Yuen, it also takes considerable
                effort to find the right light, time, vantage point and subject to capture that unforgettable moment.
                From landscape photography we are turning to street photography, or at least urban photography. We have
                been battling the Covid-19 pandemic for a year now. Wearing masks has become part of our daily lives.
                That has not always gone down well with photographers who like to photograph people on the streets.
                Photographer Birdy Chu and some of his students at the Department of Media and Communication at the City
                University of Hong Kong have taken our new normal as their subject, as they show us in the exhibition
                âMasked Lifeâ at the Goethe-Institut Gallery. The Giocoso Trio was formed in 2018 by three friends who
                were studying in Britainâs Royal College of Music. They say the Italian word âgiocosoâ, which means
                lively and humorous, is often used as a direction in music, and best describes the kind of music they
                want to create with the flute, clarinet and piano.</td>

                pandemic. Labour secretary Law Chi-kwong said yesterday that the government is seeking to relax the
                criteria for a basic subsidy for low-income families, to allow around 24,000 more underemployed
                households to benefit from the scheme for a year. The Indian government has warned Twitter to re-block
                access to accounts on its platform linked to the farmersâ protests, or to face legal penalties. The
                social media platform had originally complied with a government request on Monday to suspend access to
                around 200 Twitter accounts, but then unblocked them following uproar from free speech proponents. On
